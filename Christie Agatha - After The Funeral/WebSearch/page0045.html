Agatha ChristieSusan took in the tray and Miss Gilchrist, following with teapot and kettle, greeted Mr Guthrie.â€˜Hot scones, how lovely,â€™ said Mr Guthrie.Miss Gilchrist was delighted. The scones were excellent. The memory of the Willow Tree tearoom seemed to be in the room with them. Miss Gilchrist was clearly doing what she had been born to do.â€˜I do feel rather guilty,â€™ said Mr Guthrie, â€˜enjoying my tea here, where poor Cora was so horribly murdered.â€™Miss Gilchrist shook her head. â€˜No, no.
