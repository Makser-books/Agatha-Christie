Agatha Christieâ€˜Well, young Andrews, the driver of the post van, doesnâ€™t remember delivering the parcel with the wedding cake in it. He canâ€™t be sure, though, so thereâ€™s a doubt about it.â€™â€˜But - whatâ€™s the alternative?â€™â€˜The alternative, Mrs Banks, is that an old piece of brown paper was used to wrap the parcel that already had Miss Gilchristâ€™s name and address on it and a used postage stamp. That package was then pushed through the letter box or put inside the door by hand to make her think that it had come by post. Itâ€™s a clever idea to choose wedding cake. Lonely middle-aged women are sentimental about wedding cake because they are so pleased to have been remembered by the young couple.â€™â€˜Was there enough poison in it to - kill? â€™â€˜That depends on whether Miss Gilchrist ate all of it. She thinks that she didnâ€™t, so Iâ€™d like to go upstairs if you donâ€™t mind, Mrs Banks.â€™â€˜Of course.â€™ She followed him up to Miss Gilchristâ€™s room and said, â€˜Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s in a terrible state. I didnâ€™t have time to clean up before the funeral and then after Dr Proctor came I thought perhaps I ought to leave it as it was.â€™â€˜That was very intelligent of you, Mrs Banks.â€™ He went to the bed and lifted the pillow. â€˜There you are,â€™ he said, smiling.A piece of wedding cake lay on the sheet.â€˜How extraordinary,â€™ said Susan.â€˜Oh no, itâ€™s not. Perhaps your generation doesnâ€™t do it. But itâ€™s an old custom. They say that if you put a piece of wedding cake under your pillow, youâ€™ll dream of your future husband. Miss Gilchrist didnâ€™t want to tell us about it, I suspect, because she felt silly doing such a thing at her age. But I thought thatâ€™s what it might be.â€™ His face became serious. â€˜And if it hadnâ€™t been for an old maidâ€™s foolishness, Miss Gilchrist might not be alive today.â€™
