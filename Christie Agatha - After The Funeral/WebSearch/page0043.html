Agatha Christieâ€˜Forgive me, my dear, I was thinking about your Uncle Timothy. I am a little worried.â€™â€˜I wouldnâ€™t worry. Uncle Timothy is not ill at all - heâ€™s just a hypochondriac.â€™â€˜It is not  his health that is worrying me. Itâ€™s Maudeâ€™s. Apparently she has fallen downstairs and broken her ankle. Sheâ€™s got to stay in bed and your uncle is terribly worried.â€™â€˜Because heâ€™ll have to look after her instead of the other way around? It will do him a lot of good,â€™ said Susan.â€˜Yes - yes, but will your poor aunt get any looking after?â€™ They came out of the Kingâ€™s Arms, rather warily but the newspaper reporters and photographers had gone.Mr Entwhistle took them back to the cottage then returned to the Kingâ€™s Arms where he had booked a room. The funeral was to be on the following day.â€˜My carâ€™s still in the quarry,â€™ said Susan when she and Miss Gilchrist had gone inside. â€˜Iâ€™ll go and get it and drive it along to the village later.â€™Miss Gilchrist said anxiously, â€˜You will do that in daylight, wonâ€™t you?â€™Susan laughed. â€˜You donâ€™t think the murderer is still nearby, do you?â€™â€˜No â€” no, I suppose not.â€™ Miss Gilchrist looked embarrassed. But itâ€™s exactly what she does think, thought Susan.Miss Gilchrist went towards the kitchen. â€˜Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d like tea, Mrs Banks!â€™Susan went into the sitting room. She had only been there a few minutes when the doorbell rang. Susan went to the front door and opened it. An elderly gentleman said, smiling, â€˜My name is Alexander Guthrie. I was a very old friend of Cora Lansquenetâ€™s. May I ask who you are?â€™38
