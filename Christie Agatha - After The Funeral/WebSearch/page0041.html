Agatha Christiethings in store in case - some day - I would need them. I had a small tearoom at one time, you know - then the war came . . . But I didnâ€™t sell everything, because I did hope to have my own little home again one day, so I put the best things in store with my fatherâ€™s pictures. But I would like very much, if you really wouldnâ€™t mind, to have that little painted tea table. Such a pretty thing and we always had tea on it.â€™Susan, looking at what she thought was an ugly green table painted with large purple flowers, said that she would be delighted for Miss Gilchrist to have it.â€˜Thank you very much, Mrs Banks. I imagine you would like to look through her things? After the inquest, perhaps?â€™ Miss Gilchrist asked.â€˜I thought Iâ€™d stay here a couple of days and clear everything up.â€™ â€˜Sleep here, you mean?â€™â€˜Yes. Is there any difficulty?â€™â€˜Oh no, Iâ€™ll put fresh sheets on my bed, and I can sleep down here on the couch.â€™â€˜But thereâ€™s Aunt Coraâ€™s room, isnâ€™t there? I can sleep in that.â€™ â€˜You - you wouldnâ€™t mind? â€™â€˜You mean because she was murdered there? Oh no. Iâ€™m very practical, Miss Gilchrist. Itâ€™s been - I mean - itâ€™s been cleaned?â€™ â€˜Oh yes, Mrs Banks. All the blankets were sent away to the laundry and the whole room was cleaned thoroughly.â€™She led the way upstairs. The room where Cora Lansquenet had died was clean and fresh and had no sinister atmosphere. Over the fireplace an oil painting showed a young woman about to enter her bath.Susan gave a slight shudder as she looked at it and Miss Gilchrist said, â€˜That was painted by Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s husband. There are a lot more of his pictures in the dining room.â€™36
