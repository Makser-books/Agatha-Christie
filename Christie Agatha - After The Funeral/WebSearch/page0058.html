After the Funeralone of my young ladies, whoâ€™s knowledgeable about the theatre and the people in it, to follow her and stop by her table in a restaurant, She exclaimed the way they do, â€œDarling, I havenâ€™t seen you since Way Down Under. You were wonderful in that!â€ In a minute they were talking theatrical stuff and my girl then said, â€œI believe I saw you at so and so, on so and so,â€ giving the day. Most ladies are tricked by that and say, â€œOh no, I was . . .â€ whatever it may be. But Mrs Shane just looked blank and said, â€œOh, maybe. I couldnâ€™t possibly remember.â€ What can you do with a lady like that? â€™ Mr Goby shook his head sadly.â€˜Nothing,â€™ said Hercule Poirot with some feeling. â€˜I shall never forget the killing of Lord Edgware. I was nearly defeated â€” yes, I, Hercule Poirot - by the extremely simple cleverness of an empty brain. Very simple-minded people often have the unexpected intelligence to commit a simple crime and then leave it alone. Let us hope that our murderer is intelligent and thoroughly pleased with himself and unable to resist showing off. But continue.â€™Once more Mr Goby looked at his little book. â€˜Mr and Mrs Banks said they were at home all day. Well, Susan Banks wasnâ€™t. She went round to the garage, got out her car, and drove off in it at about one oâ€™clock. We do not know where she went and she came back at about five. I have no idea how many miles she did that day because she drives every day and, unlike Michael Shaneâ€™s hired car, no one keeps a note of the mileage.â€˜As for Mr Gregory Banks, we donâ€™t know what he did. He didnâ€™t go to work and it seems he had already asked for a couple of days off because of the funeral. Since then heâ€™s left his job - where they do not like Mr Banks. He used to become very angry at even small things that upset him. Until about four months53
