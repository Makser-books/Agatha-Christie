Cultural notesMonsieur PoirotPoirot is from Belgium and his first language is French, not English. His language is quite formal, which makes it sound â€˜foreignâ€™ to a native speaker. Sometimes Poirot says things that are not completely correct. The word order he uses may be wrong or he may use a word wrongly, for example, he may say good when he should have said well or the other way round. He often uses little French expressions like mort ami (my friend) or Eh bien (Oh well).Wedding cakeAt the time of the story, if you had been invited to a wedding but were unable to attend, it was usual for the couple getting married to send you a piece of their wedding cake in a small box.Trust fundA trust fund is an amount of money that belongs to someone but is managed by someone else, for example, if the person is too young or they are not considered responsible or knowledgeable enough to take care of it themselves. Quite often the money is invested and the person who owns it only receives the profits or interest, leaving the original amount safe. It is common for a solicitor to be the person who controls a trust fund. In the story, Richardâ€™s nephew George, who is a solicitor, is suspected of using money from his clientsâ€™ trust funds to gamble with at the horse races.RefugeesRefugees are people who have to leave their countries because of their political or religious beliefs. At the time this story was written, there were many refugees in Britain. Some were Jews who had left Eastern Europe during or before the Second World War, others had come as a result of the expansion of Communism in Eastern Europe after the war. Nobody would have thought it unusual for someone like Poirot to be representing an organization that helped refugees.
