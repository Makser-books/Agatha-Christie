After the Funeralsame thing. She is being taken to a nursing home where no one will be allowed in to see her. But now, there is something that I want you to do. One moment.â€™ There was a pause, then Poirotâ€™s voice spoke again. â€˜I had to make sure that nobody was listening. Now, you will go to Forsdyke House, a nursing home in Bury St Edmunds. Find Dr Penrith and ask him about Gregory Banks. Find out what kind of mental illness he was being treated for.

Would it be too much trouble to bring me a cup of coffee in my bedroom? â€™ â€˜Certainly, Sir.

The detective was wearing a brightly coloured silk dressing gown.Hercule Poirot was dressed by the time Janet brought him his coffee. As soon as she had left the room, Poirot put on his coat and hat and went quickly down the back stairs and left the house by the side door. Soon he was speaking to Mr Entwhistle from the post office.â€˜Pay no attention to what I asked you to do. Someone was listening. Now, to what I really want you to do . . . You must go81
