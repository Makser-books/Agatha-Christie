After the Funeralâ€˜How terrible! Where are Aunt Coraâ€™s own pictures?â€™â€˜In my room. Would you like to see them?â€™Miss Gilchrist proudly showed her the paintings.Susan commented that it looked like Aunt Cora was very fond of villages by the sea and that perhaps her paintings, which were very detailed and very brightly coloured, might have been painted from picture postcards.But Miss Gilchrist was indignant. Mrs Lansquenet always painted from nature!â€˜Mrs Lansquenet was a real artist,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist sharply. She looked at her watch and Susan said quickly, â€˜Yes, we ought to leave for the inquest. Is it far? Shall I get the car?â€™It was only five minutesâ€™ walk, Miss Gilchrist said, so they left together on foot. Mr Entwhistle, who had travelled by train, met them at the Village Hall.At the inquest, the dead woman was identified. It was said that death was unlikely to have occurred later than four-thirty. Miss Gilchrist testified to finding the body. A police constable and Inspector Morton gave their evidence and the jury was quick to reach the verdict: Murder by some person or persons unknown.Afterwards, when they came out again into the sunlight, half a dozen newspaper cameras clicked. Mr Entwhistle took them into the Kingâ€™s Arms pub for lunch in a private room. He said to Susan, â€˜I had no idea you were coming down today, Susan. We could have come together. Did your husband come with you?â€™â€˜Greg had some important things to do. Weâ€™ve got great plans for the future - we are going to open a beauty salon, which I will run, and a laboratory where Greg can make face creams.â€™Mr Entwhistleâ€™s mind went to other things. When Susan had spoken to him twice without his answering, he apologized.37
