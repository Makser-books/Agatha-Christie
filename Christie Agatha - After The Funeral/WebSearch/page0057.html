Agatha Christieâ€˜What he said about being at Hurst Park races is almost certainly untrue. None of the people he usually places his bets with saw him. Nobody saw him in Lytchett St Mary either, but that doesnâ€™t mean he wasnâ€™t there. There are other ways to approach the cottage than through the village. He acted in plays at university, by the way. So if he went to the cottage that day, he could have used make up to change the way he looks. Iâ€™ll keep him in my book, shall I?â€™â€˜You may keep him in,â€™ said Hercule Poirot.Mr Goby turned another page. â€˜Mr Michael Shane. He likes money and is very attractive to women. Heâ€™s been having an affair with Sorrel Dainton, the actress, and his wife Rosamund doesnâ€™t know about it. She doesnâ€™t know much about anything, it seems. Sheâ€™s not a good actress, and is crazy about her husband.â€˜On the day Mr Shane says he was meeting a Mr Rosenheim and a Mr Oscar Lewis for lunch to discuss a play, he sent them a telegram to say he couldnâ€™t come. What he did do was to go to the Emeraldo Car people and hire a car at about twelve oâ€™clock. He returned it at about six in the evening. The car had been driven just about the right number of miles, but it was not seen in Lytchett St Mary that day. However, there are lots of places he could have left it hidden a mile or so away; thereâ€™s even an old quarry a few hundred yards down the road from the cottage. Do we keep Mr Shane in? â€™â€˜Most certainly.â€™â€˜Now  Mrs Shane.â€™ Mr Goby told his left sleeve about Rosamund Shane. â€˜She says she was shopping. And she had heard she had inherited money the day before. She has accounts in a number of shops but she hasnâ€™t paid her bills, so itâ€™s possible that she went in here and there, trying on clothes, looking at jewellery, checking prices â€” and not buying anything!
