After the Funeralâ€˜What absolute nonsensel He wasnâ€™t even near this place when Uncle Richard died!â€™â€˜Perhaps not. Where was he when Cora Lansquenet died?â€™â€˜In London. We both were.â€™Hercule Poirot shook his head. â€˜No, no. You went to Lytchett St Mary. My inquiries say that you were there on the afternoon Cora Lansquenet died. You parked your car in the same quarry where you left it the morning of the inquest. The car was seen and the number was noted.â€™Susan stared at him. â€˜All right. What Cora said at the funeral worried me. I decided to go and see her, and ask her what had put the idea into her head. I got there about three oâ€™clock, knocked and rang, but there was no answer. I didnâ€™t go round to the back of the cottage. If I had, I might have seen the broken window. I went back to London without any idea there was anything wrong.â€™â€˜I know something of your husbandâ€™s history,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜He has a punishment complex.â€™â€˜You donâ€™t understand, Monsieur Poirot. Greg has never had a chance in life. Thatâ€™s why I wanted Uncle Richardâ€™s money so badly. I knew Greg needed to feel he was someone. Everything will be different now. He will have his own laboratory. No one will tell him what to do.â€™â€˜Yes, yes â€” you will give him everything â€” but you cannot give to people what they are not capable of receiving. At the end of it all, he will still be something that he does not want to be.â€™â€˜Whatâ€™s that?â€™â€˜Susanâ€™s husband. Where Gregory Banks is concerned you have no sense of right or wrong. You wanted your uncleâ€™s money - for your husband. How badly did you want it?â€™87
