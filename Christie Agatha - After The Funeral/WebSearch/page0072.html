Chapter 16Hercule Poirot drank his after-dinner coffee slowly and between half-closed eyes looked at the other people in the room. He had wanted them there â€” all together, and he had got them. Mr Entwhistle had described all these people well but Poirot had wanted to see for himself, then he would have a very good idea â€” not of how and when â€” but of who would be prepared to kill.But it was not going to be easy. He could see almost all of these people as a possible â€” though not a likely â€” murderer.George Crossfield might kill - as a hunted animal might kill to defend itself.Susan Banks could do it calmly â€” efficiently â€” to further a plan.Gregory Banks could, because he had something in him which wanted punishment.Michael Shane was possible because he was ambitious and had a murdererâ€™s vanity.Rosamund Shane could, because she saw everything in the most simple way.Timothy Abernethie could do it because he really wanted the power his brotherâ€™s money would give him.Maude Abernethie might be able because Timothy had become her child and where her child was concerned, she would be ruthless.Even Miss Gilchrist, he thought, might have thought about murdering someone if it could have given her back the Willow Tree tearoom!And Helen Abernethie? She was too civilized â€” too lacking in violence. And she had loved Richard Abernethie as a brother.67
