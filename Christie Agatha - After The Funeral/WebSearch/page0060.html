After the Funeralâ€˜Everyone says she is a very nice lady. She left Enderby by car and arrived on foot at a small garage in a village on the way. She explained that her car had broken down a couple of miles away.â€˜A mechanic drove her out to it and said they would have to get it in to the garage and it would be a long job.

She came there to stay about two weeks before he died.â€™â€˜Was that after he had been to Lytchett St Mary to see his sister?â€™â€˜No, just before.
