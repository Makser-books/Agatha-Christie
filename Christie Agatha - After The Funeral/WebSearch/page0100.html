After the FuneralMrs Helen Abernethie who had not seen her for over thirty years.â€˜So I said to myself: â€œSupposing it was not Cora Lansquenet who came to the funeral that day?â€™â€â€˜Do you mean that it wasnâ€™t Aunt Cora who was murdered, but someone else?â€™ Susan demanded.â€˜No, no, it was Cora Lansquenet who was murdered.

Yet Mrs Lansquenet painted always from life. Mr Entwhistle had mentioned there being a smell of oil paint in the cottage. You can paint, canâ€™t you, Miss Gilchrist? And you had been painting over another picture. You know a lot about painting. Supposing that one of the pictures that Cora bought at a sale was a really valuable one. Supposing that she did not recognize it, but that95
