Agatha Christieâ€˜I hoped that by a few casual questions I could clear certain members of the family from suspicion, perhaps all of them. In which case, Cora would have been wrong and her own death must have been done by a criminal who broke in. After all, it is simple. What were the members of the Abernethie family doing on the afternoon that Cora Lansquenet was killed? â€™â€˜Eh bien.â€™ said Poirot, â€˜what were they doing? â€™â€˜George Crossfield was at Hurst Park horse-races. Rosamund Shane was shopping in London. Her husband was at lunch discussing a play. Susan and Gregory Banks were at home all day. Timothy Abernethie was at his home in Yorkshire, and his wife was driving herself home from Enderby.â€™Hercule Poirot nodded. â€˜Yes, that is what they say. And is it all true?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know, Poirot. George may have been at Hurst Park races, but I do not think he was. He said that he had bet on a couple of winners. I asked him the names and both horses he named had, I found, been expected to win â€” but only one had.â€™ â€˜Interesting. Had this George any urgent need for money at the time of his uncleâ€™s death?â€™â€˜I have no evidence, but I suspect that he has been gambling with his clientsâ€™ money.â€™ He sighed. As for Rosamund, she is lovely, but not very intelligent. Her husband, Michael Shane, is a man with ambition. But I have no reason to suspect him of a violent crime. However, until I know that he really was doing what he says he was doing, I cannot take him off my list of suspects.â€™â€˜You have no doubts about Rosamund, the wife?â€™â€˜No â€” no â€” she is a delicate-looking creature.â€™â€˜And beautiful!â€™ said Poirot with a smile. â€˜And the other niece?â€™
