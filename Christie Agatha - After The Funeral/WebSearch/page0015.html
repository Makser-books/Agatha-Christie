Chapter 4At a quarter to six the next evening Mr Entwhistleâ€™s telephone rang. The caller informed him that Mrs Cora Lansquenet had been murdered in her cottage in the village of Lytchett St Mary.? ? ?The next day a police Inspector named Morton came to see him and said, â€˜Itâ€™s not a very easy case. Mr Entwhistle. Letâ€™s imagine someone was watching Cora Lansquenetâ€™s house and saw her companion. Miss Gilchrist, come out of the house at about two oâ€™clock. This someone then deliberately takes the hatchet that was lying by the woodshed, smashes the kitchen window, gets into the house, goes upstairs, and attacks Mrs Lansquenet. She was hit six or eight times â€” it was a very violent crime. Then he opens a few cupboards, picks up a few pieces of cheap jewellery, and makes his escape.â€™â€˜She was in bed?â€™â€˜Yes. She returned late from the North the night before and woke with a terrible headache. She took some painkillers but felt no better by lunchtime. She decided to take two sleeping pills and sent Miss Gilchrist into town to change some library books. When this man broke in he could have taken what he wanted just by threatening her. Why did he need to kill her? It looks like she was sleeping peacefully when she was attacked.â€™â€˜We do hear of pointless murders,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said.Oh yes, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for any suspicious stranger who was seen in the neighbourhood: the local people all have alibis. Of course, her cottage is up a little road outside the village. Anyone could get there without being seen. There has been no10
