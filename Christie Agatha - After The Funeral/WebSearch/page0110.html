Cultural notesweek. This was called rationing and most items of food, for example, meat, butter, eggs, tea, biscuits, fruit, sugar and chocolate were rationed. Food rationing lasted until 1954.InquestsIf a death has been caused by anything other than natural causes, for example, a heart attack or long illness (as with Richard Abernethie) an inquest must be held. This is a public inquiry with a jury of twelve ordinary people, and a coroner, who is in charge at the inquest. Everybody, including members of the public, listen to the evidence. The jury then give their verdict and say what the cause of death was, for example, natural death, accidental death, suicide or murder. In the case of murder, a police investigation then takes place.Post mortems, autopsiesIn the UK, when a person dies, a doctor has to certify the cause of death. If the doctor does not know exactly why the person died, and the death was sudden and rather suspicious, they have to do a post mortem, also called an autopsy. This is a medical examination done by a doctor called a pathologist, who removes the internal organs of the dead person and examines them to discover the cause of death. When Richard Abernethie died, it was decided that an autopsy was unnecessary because he had been ill. Later when there was some doubt about the cause of his death, an autopsy was impossible because his body had been cremated (see Glossary). With the murder of one of Richardâ€™s relatives later in the story, an autopsy was again not done because the cause of death was obvious - the victim had been violently attacked.
