Chapter 9The front-door bell rang and for some reason Miss Gilchrist felt nervous. She went unwillingly to the door, telling herself not to be so silly.A young woman dressed in black and carrying a small suitcase was standing on the step outside. She noticed the nervous look on Miss Gilchristâ€™s face and said quickly, â€˜Miss Gilchrist? I am Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s niece â€” Susan Banks.â€™â€˜Oh dear, yes, of course. Do come in, Mrs Banks.

Unless â€” is there any of it you would like? Iâ€™d be very happy . . .â€™ She stopped, a little embarrassed.
