After the Funeralâ€˜Susan? She is a girl of huge ability, I think. She and her husband were at home together that day. I said that I had tried to telephone them on the afternoon in question â€” I hadnâ€™t, of course. Greg said very quickly that the telephone had not been working all day.â€™â€˜So again there is no evidence . . . What is the husband like?â€™ â€˜He does not have a pleasing personality, though I cannot say exactly why. Susan has the mental strength and intelligence of Richard Abernethie. But I feel that she lacks the kindness and warmth of my old friend.â€™â€˜Women are never kind,â€™ remarked Poirot. â€˜Though they can sometimes be gentle. Does she love her husband? â€™â€˜She loves him almost too much, I would say.â€™â€˜Me, I am not so sentimental about beautiful young ladies! Now tell me about your visit to the older members of the Abernethie family.â€™Mr Entwhistle described his visit to Timothy and Maude and Poirot nodded.â€˜So Mrs Maude Abernethie is a good car mechanic. And Mr Timothy Abernethie is not the sick man he likes to think himself. He also resented his brotherâ€™s success. What about the sixth beneficiary? â€™â€˜Helen? I do not suspect her for a moment. Anyway, she was at Enderby. With three servants in the house.â€™â€˜Eh bien, my friend,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜What do you want me to do?â€™â€˜I want to know the truth, Poirot. I know you donâ€™t take cases any more, but I ask you to take this one. And I will be responsible for your fees. Come now, money is always useful.â€™ Poirot smiled. â€˜Not if it all goes in the taxes! But I will admit, your problem interests me! Because it is not easy . . . But I think29
