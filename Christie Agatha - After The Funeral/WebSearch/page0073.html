Agatha ChristiePoirot sighed. There would have to be more conversation. Much more conversation. For in conversation, either through a lie or through truth, people always gave themselves away.He had been introduced by Helen to the group as Monsieur Pontarlier, a doctor, the representative of U.N.A.R.C.O. He had watched and listened â€” openly and behind doors! He had talked with all of them, had spent a long half-hour listening to Timothy talking about his health and the terrible effects of paint on it. Paint? Poirot frowned. Somebody else had said something about paint â€” Mr Entwhistle?There had also been a discussion of a different kind of painting. Pierre Lansquenet as a painter; of Cora Lansquenetâ€™s paintings, praised by Miss Gilchrist, laughed at by Susan.â€˜Just like picture postcards,â€™ she had said. â€˜She painted them from postcards, too.â€™Miss Gilchrist had been upset and had said that dear Mrs Lansquenet always painted from nature.â€˜But she didnâ€™t,â€™ said Susan to Poirot when Miss Gilchrist had gone out of the room.â€˜And how do you know?â€™Poirot watched the confident way Susan replied.She will always be sure, this one, he thought. And perhaps sometimes, she will be too sure . . .Susan continued, â€˜One picture is of a village called Polflexan, showing the lighthouse and the pier. But the pier was destroyed in the war, and since Aunt Coraâ€™s sketch was only done two years ago, it canâ€™t really be from nature, can it? But the postcards they sell there still show the pier as it used to be. There was one in her bedroom. Itâ€™s funny, isnâ€™t it, the way people get found out?â€™â€˜Yes, it is, as you say, funny.â€™68
