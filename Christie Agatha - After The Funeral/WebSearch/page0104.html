Chapter 23â€˜But I donâ€™t understand the connection between the wax flowers and the marble table,â€™ said Rosamund.They were at Helenâ€™s flat and Rosamund and Poirot were having tea with her.â€˜The table, no. But Miss Gilchrist said how nice the wax flowers looked on the green marble table. And she could not have seen them there. Because they had been broken and put away before she arrived. So she could only have seen them when she was there as Cora Lansquenet.â€™â€˜That was stupid of her, wasnâ€™t it?â€™ said Rosamund.Poirot shook a fmger at her. â€˜It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversations. It is a strong belief of mine that if you can get a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject ivhatever â€” sooner or later they will give themselves away. Miss Gilchrist did.â€™â€˜I shall have to be careful,â€™ said Rosamund thoughtfully. â€˜Did you know? Iâ€™m going to have a baby. And Iâ€™ve decided to leave the stage and just be a mother. Michael is delighted. I didnâ€™t really think he would be. So Susanâ€™s got the marble table. I thought, as I was having a baby . . .â€™She left the sentence unfinished.â€˜I think Susan is going to have a big success with her beauty business,â€™ said Helen.â€˜Yes, she was born to succeed,â€™ said Poirot.â€˜Gregâ€™s gone away somewhere,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜Heâ€™s having a rest cure, Susan says.â€™Poirot turned to Helen. â€˜And you, Madame, are off to Cyprus?â€™99
