After the Funeralbeen a servant. I used to have a little tearoom: The Willow Tree - it was a lovely place. All the cups and plates were blue and the cakes were really good. I was doing well and then the war came and food supplies were cut and I had to close the tearoom and had no money to pay the rent. And so I had to look round for something to do, but, I had never been trained for anything.

I gave her a cup of hot milk and she told me that the church had been full and that she was sorry she hadnâ€™t seen her other brother - Timothy. Well, then she said she would go to bed.â€™â€˜She said nothing else that you can remember specially?â€™â€˜She asked me if I would like to go to Italy. Italy!
