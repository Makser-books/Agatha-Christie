After the Funeralâ€˜I suppose youâ€™ll have to cut Enderby up and have lots of horrible small rooms.â€™â€˜In the bedrooms, yes. But most of the ground floor rooms we shall not touch. Does it sadden you, Madame, that this old family mansion of yours should go this way â€” to strangers?â€™â€˜Of course not.â€™ Susan looked amused. â€˜Iâ€™ve always thought the house was ugly on the outside - and almost unacceptably luxurious inside.â€™â€˜But I understand that you yourself are planning such a place? Everything luxurious and the best that money can buy.â€™Susan laughed. â€˜Itâ€™s just a place of business. Women think a great deal about their appearance â€” and thatâ€™s where I come in.â€™ â€˜Tell me.â€™And she told him about her plans for a beauty salon. He appreciated her business sense, her boldness of planning and her attention to detail. Perhaps a little ruthless . . . Watching her, he had said, â€˜Yes, you will succeed. How fortunate that you have the money. To have had these creative ideas and to have had no money . . . â€™â€˜I would have raised the money somehow â€” got someone to invest in me!â€™â€˜Ah! Of course. Even if he had not died, your uncle would have invested in you.â€™â€˜Oh no, he wouldnâ€™t. Uncle Richard made me very angry. The old shouldnâ€™t stand in the way of the young. I â€” oh, I beg your pardon.â€™Hercule Poirot laughed easily and stroked his moustache. â€˜I am old, yes. But I do not stand in the way of young people. And here is your husband come to join our little discussion . . . We talk, Mr Banks, of opportunity â€” opportunity that must be taken with both hands. Let us hear your views.â€™
