Agatha Christieâ€˜Sheâ€™s really bad then?â€™ asked Susan.â€˜Yes. Iâ€™ve given her morphia to ease the pain. But it looks. . .â€™ He paused. â€˜What has she eaten?â€™â€˜We had macaroni and cheese for dinner and a milk pudding and then coffee afterwards.â€™â€˜Did you have the same things?â€™â€˜Yes.â€™â€˜And sheâ€™s eaten nothing else? No tinned fish? Or sausages?â€™ â€˜No.â€™The ambulance came and took Miss Gilchrist away. The doctor went with her. When he had left, Susan went upstairs to bed. This time she fell asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.? ? ?A large number of people came to Cora Lansquenetâ€™s funeral. Most of the villagers were there and wreaths had been sent by the other members of the family. Mr Entwhistle asked where Miss Gilchrist was, and Susan explained. Mr Entwhistle was surprised. â€˜Wasnâ€™t that strange?â€™â€˜Oh, sheâ€™s better this morning. They called from the hospital. People do get these stomach upsets.â€™Mr Entwhistle said no more. He was returning to London immediately after the funeral.Susan went back to the cottage and made herself an omelette. Then she went up to Coraâ€™s room and started to sort through the dead womanâ€™s things.She was interrupted by the arrival of the doctor, who was looking worried.â€˜Mrs Banks, will you tell me again exactly what Miss Gilchrist had to eat and drink yesterday. Everything. There must have been something she had and you didnâ€™t?â€™
