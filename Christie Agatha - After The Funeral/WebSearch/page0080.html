After the Funeralsay that this house will be perfect for my elderly refugees. What peace! I hear that there was also the question of a school coming here, run by â€œnunsâ€, I think you say? You would have preferred that, perhaps?â€™â€˜Not at all,â€™ said George. â€˜But what I do find strange is why they should all dress as if they lived hundreds of years ago!â€™â€˜And it makes them look so alike, doesnâ€™t it?â€™ said Miss Gilchrist. â€˜I got so nervous when I was at Mrs Abernethieâ€™s and a nun came to the door. I thought she was the same nun who came to the door on the day of the inquest on poor Mrs Lansquenet. I felt as though she had been following me round!â€™â€˜They both had the same type of face?â€™ Hercule Poirot asked. â€˜I suppose that must be it. The upper lip looked almost as though she had a moustache. Of course it was very foolish of me. I knew that afterwards.â€™â€˜A nunâ€™s costume would be a good disguise.â€™ said Susan thoughtfully, â€˜even for a man. It hides the feet.â€™â€˜The truth is,â€™ said George, â€˜you donâ€™t often look properly at anyone. Thatâ€™s why there are such very different descriptions of what an accused person looks like from different witnesses in court.â€™â€˜Another strange thing,â€™ said Susan, â€˜is that you sometimes see yourself in a mirror unexpectedly and you say to yourself, â€œThatâ€™s somebody I know well . . .â€ and then suddenly realize itâ€™s you! â€™George said, â€˜It would be more difficult still if you could really see yourself â€” and not a mirror image.â€™â€˜Why?â€™ asked Rosamund, looking puzzled.â€˜Because nobody ever sees themselves â€” as they appear to other people. They always see themselves in a mirror as a reversed image.â€™75
