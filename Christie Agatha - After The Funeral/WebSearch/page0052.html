After the Funeralâ€˜I donâ€™t think so . . . scones, jam, tea â€” and then supper. No, I canâ€™t remember anything. Was it food poisoning?â€™â€˜It was arsenic.â€™ he said.â€˜Arsenic? You mean somebody gave her arsenic?â€™â€˜Thatâ€™s what it looks like.â€™â€˜Could the arsenic have got into her food or drink by accident? â€™ â€˜It seems very unlikely, although such things have been known. But if you and she ate the same things . . .â€™Susan gave a sudden exclamation. â€˜Why, of course, the wedding cake! I didnâ€™t have any of that, though she offered me some.â€™ Susan explained about the cake that had arrived.â€˜Strange. And you say she wasnâ€™t sure who sent it? Is there any of it left? Or is the box it came in still here somewhere?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know.â€™They found the white box in the kitchen with a few very small pieces of cake still in it.â€˜Iâ€™ll take this,â€™ the doctor said. â€˜Do you have any idea where the wrapping paper it came in might be?â€™ They looked but they did not find it.â€˜You wonâ€™t be leaving here just yet, Mrs Banks?â€™ His voice was friendly, but it made Susan feel a little uncomfortable. â€˜No, I will be here for a few days.â€™â€˜Good. You understand the police will probably want to ask some questions. You donâ€™t know of anyone who â€” well, might have wanted to hurt Miss Gilchrist? â€™Susan shook her head. â€˜I donâ€™t really know much about her. She was with my aunt for some years â€” thatâ€™s all I know.â€™â€˜Right. Well, I must go now.â€™The cottage felt hot and uncomfortable and when he had gone Susan left the front door wide open and she went slowly upstairs to continue going through Aunt Coraâ€™s belongings.
