Agatha Christiegirls have made bad marriages, if you ask me. Well, I thought Richard was asking for my advice because I would be head of the family after he died, and so I thought the control of the money would be mine.â€™In his excitement Timothy had kicked aside the blanket that covered his legs and sat up straight in his chair. He looked, Mr Entwhistle thought, a perfectly healthy man.â€˜Will you have a drink, Entwhistle?â€™â€˜Not quite so soon. Maude has just given me an excellent tea.â€™ Timothy looked at him. â€˜Sheâ€™s a capable woman. Maude. She even fixes that old car of ours â€” sheâ€™s a good mechanic in her way, you know.â€™â€˜Yes, I hear the car broke down coming back from the funeral. Timothy, I donâ€™t know how much Maude told you about the funeral and the relatives. Cora said that Richard had been murdered. Perhaps Maude told you.â€™Timothy laughed. â€˜Thatâ€™s just the sort of thing Cora would say!â€™Maude came into the room and said firmly, â€˜I think, Timothy dear, that Mr Entwhistle has been with you long enough. You really must rest. If you have arranged everything . . .â€™â€˜Oh, weâ€™ve arranged things. Iâ€™ll leave it all to you, Entwhistle. Youâ€™ll see to Coraâ€™s funeral - wonâ€™t you? We shanâ€™t be able to come, but send an expensive wreath from us.â€™Mr Entwhistle left for London by the breakfast train the following morning.When he got home, he telephoned a friend of his.24
