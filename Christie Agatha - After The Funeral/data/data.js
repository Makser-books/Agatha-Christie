Soon they would be coming back from his Masterâ€™s funeral. Mr Richard Abernethie had been a good employer. He had died very suddenly, aged sixty-eight. Although he was ill, the family doctor thought that he would live for another two years. Ah, but the Master had never recovered from his sonâ€™s death, six months before. Mortimer Abernethieâ€™s death was a huge shock because he was such a strong and healthy young man.Mr Richard was twenty-four when his father, Cornelius, died, and he had gone straight into the family business. He ran it successfully while keeping a very happy home in this huge Victorian house. He was like a father to his younger brothers and sisters. Now Leo, Laura, Geraldine, and Gordon were dead, only Timothy and Cora were left. It had been twenty-five years since Lanscombe had seen Cora, and he hadnâ€™t recognized her when she arrived before the funeral. She had grown so fat â€” and was dressed in a loose black dress with too many black necklaces! Well, Miss Cora had always been a bit â€” well, strange.She had remembered him all right. Why, itâ€™s Lanscombe!â€™ she had said, and seemed so pleased to see him. Ah, they had all been fond of him in the old days.Now cars were arriving, bringing the family home, and Lanscombe showed them all into the green sitting room.A few minutes later, standing in front of the fireplace, Mr Entwhistle, the family lawyer, looked round. He did not know all the people there very well â€” some he had only met before the funeral and he needed to sort them out in his mind before he read the will. When he saw old Lanscombe handing round drinks, Mr Entwhistle thought, â€˜Poor old man - heâ€™s nearlyI]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "7">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieninety, and half blind. Well, heâ€™ll have that nice little inheritance from Richard.â€™Leo Abernethieâ€™s widow. Helen, he knew well. She was a very charming woman of fifty-one. It was strange that she had never married again after Leoâ€™s death, he thought.Mr Entwhistle moved his attention on to George Crossfield, Laura Abernethieâ€™s son. Laura had left very little money when she died five years ago. George was a lawyer and a handsome young man - but there was a dishonest feel about him.Now which of the two young women was which? Ah yes, that was Rosamund, Geraldineâ€™s daughter, looking at the wax flowers on the green marble table. She was a beautiful girl, but silly. She was an actress, not a very good one, and she had married an actor, Michael Shane, fair-haired and handsome. And he knows he is, thought Mr Entwhistle.Susan, the late Gordon Abernethieâ€™s daughter, would be much better on the stage than Rosamund, Mr Entwhistle thought - she had far more personality. She also had dark hair and eyes that were almost golden in colour. Beside her was Gregory Banks, the man she had just married. He was a pharmacistâ€™s assistant! In Mr Entwhistleâ€™s world, girls did not marry men who worked in a shop. The young man, who had a pale face, seemed uncomfortable.His eyes went on to Mrs Maude Abernethie. A big, sensible woman, she had always been a good wife to Timothy, who had been an invalid for many years. Mr Entwhistle suspected that Timothy only imagined that he was ill, that he was a hypochondriac, in fact.Then Mr Entwhistle looked next at Cora Lansquenet. Her mother had died giving birth to her. Poor little Cora! She was an awkward girl, always saying the wrong thing. She met Pierre]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "8">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralLansquenet, who was half French, at art school. At the time, Coraâ€™s brother, Richard Abernethie, suspected that Lansquenet was looking for a rich wife, but Cora, who was not rich, ran away and married him anyway. They spent most of their married life in seaside towns that other painters seemed to live in, as well.Lansquenet was a very bad painter, but Richard had generously given his young sister an income. Lansquenet had died twelve years ago, and now here was his widow, back in the home of her childhood, exclaiming with pleasure whenever she recalled some childish memory.]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "9">     <text><![CDATA[Chapter 2â€˜As you know,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜I am the executor of Richard Abernethieâ€™s will . . .â€™7 didnâ€™t know,â€™ interrupted Cora Lansquenet. â€˜Did he leave me anything?â€™Ignoring her, Entwhistle continued, â€˜Originally, Richard Abernethieâ€™s will left almost everything to his son Mortimer. After Mortimerâ€™s death, Richard decided to get to know his nephew and nieces better before he made a new will.â€™â€˜Did he leave me anything?â€™ repeated Cora.Mr Entwhistle again ignored her, â€˜Apart from a legacy to Lanscombe, everything Richard owned is going to be divided into six equal parts. Four of these will go to: Richardâ€™s brother Timothy; his nephew George Crossfield; and his nieces Susan Banks and Rosamund Shane. The other two parts are going to be invested and the income from them will be paid to Mrs Helen Abernethie, the widow of his brother Leo; and to his sister, Mrs Cora Lansquenet. After their death the money is to be divided between the other four beneficiaries or their children.â€™â€˜Thatâ€™s very nice!â€™ said Cora Lansquenet. â€˜How much?â€™â€˜About three to four thousand pounds a year.â€™â€˜Good!â€™ said Cora. â€˜I shall go and visit Italy.â€™Helen Abernethie said softly, â€˜How generous of Richard.â€™â€˜He was very fond of you,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.Helen said regretfully, â€˜I wish I had realised how ill he was.â€™ â€˜Nobody expected Richard to die as soon as he did. Even the doctor was surprised,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.â€˜â€œSuddenly, at his residenceâ€ it said in the newspaper,â€™ said Cora.â€˜I wondered then . . . Still, itâ€™s been kept quiet very nicely, hasnâ€™t it? I think youâ€™re all right. I mean - it should be kept in the family.â€™]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "10">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralThe faces that had turned towards her looked amazed.Mr Entwhistle said, â€˜Really, Cora, Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t understand what you mean.â€™Cora Lansquenet looked round in surprise. â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™ she said.5]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "11">     <text><![CDATA[Chapter 3As he returned south to London by train, Mr Entwhistle thought about what Cora had said, and how everyone had reacted. Maude had exclaimed, â€˜Really, Cora!â€™Somebody else had said, â€˜What do you mean?â€™And at once Cora had said, â€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t mean - oh, but I did think from what he said - and his death was so sudden! Oh, please forget that I said anything at all â€” I know Iâ€™m always saying the wrong thing.â€™And then there had been a discussion about Richard Abernethieâ€™s personal belongings. The house and its contents, Mr Entwhistle said, would be sold.Coraâ€™s unfortunate comment had been forgotten. After all, Cora had always been, if not subnormal, embarrassingly naive. She had always said unwelcome truths.Mr Entwhistleâ€™s thoughts stopped there. Yes, it was because Coraâ€™s comments were true, that they were so embarrassing!When Mr Entwhistle had looked at Cora earlier, she had not looked like the girl he had known. But Coraâ€™s mannerisms were still there - such as the way she tilted her head to one side as she spoke. He remembered two phrases now.â€˜But I did think from what he said . . .â€™ and â€˜His death was so sudden.â€™Yes, Richardâ€™s death had been sudden. Richardâ€™s doctor had said only months ago that if Richard looked after himself, he might live two or three years. Perhaps longer.Well, doctors could never be sure about how each patient would react to a disease. And Richard Abernethie had no great wish to live after his son Mortimerâ€™s death because there was no child or grandchild of his to inherit his fortune and his business.6]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "12">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralDuring the last six months, Richard, who had obviously been searching for an heir, had invited to stay with him, at different times, his nephew George, his niece Susan and her husband, and his niece Rosamund and her husband. Richard had also briefly visited his hypochondriac brother, Timothy.The will that Richard had eventually made told Mr Entwhistle how disappointed he was with all of them.Mr Entwhistle remembered what Cora had said earlier that day, â€˜I did think from what he said . . .â€™He asked himself, What did Richard say? And when did he say it? Did Richard visit Cora Lansquenet or was it something he wrote in a letter to her which made her ask that shocking question:â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™? ? ?Further along the train, Gregory Banks said to his wife, Susan, â€˜That aunt of yours must be completely mad!â€™â€˜Aunt Cora? Oh, yes.â€™George Crossfield said sharply. â€˜She really shouldnâ€™t say things like that. It might put ideas into peopleâ€™s heads.â€™Rosamundâ€™s husband, Michael, said, â€˜I think George is right. Itâ€™s so easy to start people talking.â€™â€˜Well, would it matter? It might be fun,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜Fun?â€™ Four voices spoke at once.â€˜Having a murder in the family,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜And if he was murdered, who do you think did it? His death has been very convenient for all of us. Michael and I are completely broke. Michael was offered a really good part in a play if he could afford to wait for it, but he couldnâ€™t. Now weâ€™ll have enough money for our own play if we want to.â€™7]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "13">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha ChristieNobody was listening. They were thinking about their own futures.â€˜Now I can put my clientsâ€™ money back in their accounts before they notice itâ€™s missing,â€™ thought George.Gregory thought, â€˜Now I can escape from this prison Iâ€™m in.â€™Susanâ€™s hard, young eyes softened as she looked at her husband. She suspected that Greg loved her less than she loved him â€” but that only strengthened her feelings. Greg was hers; she would do anything for him. Anything.? ? ?Maude Abernethie, who was staying the night at Enderby, wondered if she should offer to stay longer to help Helen with the clearing of the house. But she really had to get back to Timothy to look after him. He had expected that most of Richardâ€™s fortune would come to him and he would be annoyed - and that was so bad for his health.She sighed, then smiled. Things were going to be much easier now, financially. They could spend money on plants for the garden, for instance.? ? ?Helen Abernethie sat by the fire in the sitting room at Enderby Hall. How worried she had been lately about money. Now, thanks to Richard, all that was over.Helen looked at the bouquet of wax flowers that stood on the green marble table. Cora had been sitting beside it when they had been waiting to go to the funeral. She had been so pleased at being back in her old home. Oh, but the way Cora had asked, â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™The faces all round, shocked, staring at her!]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "14">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralAnd suddenly, seeing the picture of everyone clearly in her mind, Helen frowned. There was something wrong with that picture. Was it an expression on someoneâ€™s face? Was that it? Something that should not have been there ?No, she didnâ€™t know what it was - but there had been something, somewhere, that was wrong.? ? ?Meanwhile, in the cafe at Swindon Railway Station, a lady in black was waiting for the connecting train to Lytchett St Mary, where she lived. She was eating cakes and looking forward to the future.All those faces - when she had said that about murder! Well, it had been the right thing to say.She smiled like a happy child. She was really going to enjoy herself at last.]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "15">     <text><![CDATA[Chapter 4At a quarter to six the next evening Mr Entwhistleâ€™s telephone rang. The caller informed him that Mrs Cora Lansquenet had been murdered in her cottage in the village of Lytchett St Mary.? ? ?The next day a police Inspector named Morton came to see him and said, â€˜Itâ€™s not a very easy case. Mr Entwhistle. Letâ€™s imagine someone was watching Cora Lansquenetâ€™s house and saw her companion. Miss Gilchrist, come out of the house at about two oâ€™clock. This someone then deliberately takes the hatchet that was lying by the woodshed, smashes the kitchen window, gets into the house, goes upstairs, and attacks Mrs Lansquenet. She was hit six or eight times â€” it was a very violent crime. Then he opens a few cupboards, picks up a few pieces of cheap jewellery, and makes his escape.â€™â€˜She was in bed?â€™â€˜Yes. She returned late from the North the night before and woke with a terrible headache. She took some painkillers but felt no better by lunchtime. She decided to take two sleeping pills and sent Miss Gilchrist into town to change some library books. When this man broke in he could have taken what he wanted just by threatening her. Why did he need to kill her? It looks like she was sleeping peacefully when she was attacked.â€™â€˜We do hear of pointless murders,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said.Oh yes, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for any suspicious stranger who was seen in the neighbourhood: the local people all have alibis. Of course, her cottage is up a little road outside the village. Anyone could get there without being seen. There has been no10]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "16">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralrain for some days, so there arenâ€™t any car tracks to go by - in case anyone came by car.â€˜There are strange things about the case, Mr Entwhistle. These, for instance.â€™ Inspector Morton pushed across his desk a collection of cheap jewellery. â€˜Those are the things that were taken. They were found just outside the house, hidden in a bush.â€˜Of course the companion, Miss Gilchrist, may have killed Miss Lansquenet, but I doubt it. Everyone says they were very friendly.â€™ He paused before continuing, â€˜According to you, nobody gains from Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s death.â€™â€˜I didnâ€™t say that,â€™ replied Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s income was an allowance made to her by her brother, her house is rented, and the furniture and jewellery would not be worth much to whoever sheâ€™s left it to. However, her legacy from her brother will be divided amongst the five other beneficiaries of Richard Abernethieâ€™s will, so all of them will benefit from her death.â€™The Inspector looked disappointed. â€˜Well, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a strong motive there for anyone to kill her - and especially not with a hatchet. Youâ€™ll be going to see Miss Gilchrist, I suppose? Sheâ€™s told us, I think, everything that she can, but you never know. Sometimes, in conversation, people remember things. Sheâ€™s a sensible woman - and sheâ€™s really been most helpful.â€™Strange, thought Mr Entwhistle, that Cora had been thinking about murder the very day before she herself was murdered.â€˜He was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™It was too ridiculous to mention to Inspector Morton. But what if Miss Gilchrist could tell him what Richard had said to Cora? I must see Miss Gilchrist immediately, said Mr Entwhistle to himself.II]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "17">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie? ? ?Miss Gilchrist was a thin woman with short, grey hair. â€˜Iâ€™m so pleased you have come, Mr Entwhistle,â€™ she said. â€˜Iâ€™ve never, ever had any involvement with a murder. You read about them, of course, but I donâ€™t even really like doing that.â€™Following her into the sitting room, Mr Entwhistle looked around him. There was a strong smell of oil paint and the cottage walls were covered with mostly very dark and dirty oil paintings. But there were watercolour paintings as well, and smaller pictures were in a pile on the window seat.â€˜Mrs Lansquenet used to buy paintings at sales,â€™ Miss Gilchrist explained. â€˜She never paid more than a pound for any of them, and there was a wonderful chance, she always said, of finding something valuable.â€™Entwhistle doubted if any of these were worth even the pound she had paid for them!Of course, said Miss Gilchrist, noticing his expression, â€˜I don t know much myself, though my father was a painter â€” not a very successful one. But I used to do watercolours myself as a girl and it was nice for Mrs Lansquenet to have someone she could talk to about painting and who would understand.â€™â€˜You were fond of her?â€™Oh yesâ€™ said Miss Gilchrist. â€˜In some ways, Mrs Lansquenet was just like a child. She said anything that came into her head - but it surprised me sometimes how accurate she could be about things other than art.â€™â€˜You were with Mrs Lansquenet for some years?â€™Three and a half. I did most of the cooking â€” I enjoy cooking â€” and some light housework. None of the rough housework, of course. Mrs Panter came in for that. I could not possibly have12]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "18">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralbeen a servant. I used to have a little tearoom: The Willow Tree - it was a lovely place. All the cups and plates were blue and the cakes were really good. I was doing well and then the war came and food supplies were cut and I had to close the tearoom and had no money to pay the rent. And so I had to look round for something to do, but, I had never been trained for anything. I went to work for one lady as her companion, but she was so rude â€” and then I came to Mrs Lansquenet and we were friends from the start.â€™ Miss Gilchrist added sadly, â€˜How I loved my dear, dear little tearoom. Such nice people used to come to it!â€˜But I must not talk about myself. The police have been very kind. Inspector Morton even arranged for me to spend the night with someone in the village, but I felt it was my duty to stay here with all Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s nice things in the house. The Inspector told me there would be a policeman on duty in the kitchen all night - because of the broken window - it was fixed this morning - though to be honest, I did pull the dressing table across the door . . .â€™Mr Entwhistle said quickly, â€˜I know the main facts, but if it would not upset you too much to give me your own story of what happened . . .?â€™â€˜Of course.â€™â€˜Mrs Lansquenet got back from the funeral the night before last,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said. â€˜Did she talk about the funeral at all? â€™ â€˜Just a little. I gave her a cup of hot milk and she told me that the church had been full and that she was sorry she hadnâ€™t seen her other brother - Timothy. Well, then she said she would go to bed.â€™â€˜She said nothing else that you can remember specially?â€™â€˜She asked me if I would like to go to Italy. Italy! Of course I said it would be wonderful - and she said, â€œWeâ€™ll go!â€ She told13]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "19">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieme that her brother had left her a very good income. Poor dear. Well, Iâ€™m glad she had the pleasure of planning.â€™ Miss Gilchrist sighed, â€˜I donâ€™t suppose I shall ever go to Italy now . . .â€™â€˜And the next morning? â€™ Mr Entwhistle asked.â€˜The next morning Mrs Lansquenet wasnâ€™t at all well. Sheâ€™d had almost no sleep at all, she told me, because of bad dreams. She had her breakfast in bed, and at lunchtime she told me that she still hadnâ€™t been able to sleep. â€œI keep thinking of things and wondering,â€ she said. And then she said that she would take some sleeping tablets and try and get a good sleep in the afternoon. She wanted me to go into town and change her library books. So I left just after two and that - and that - was the last time . . .â€™ Miss Gilchrist began to cry. â€˜She must have been asleep, you know, and the Inspector says that she didnâ€™t feel anything . . . And do tell her relations that apart from having such a bad night, she was really very happy and looking forward to the future.â€™â€˜She did not speak at all about her brotherâ€™s death? The â€” er â€” cause of it?â€™â€˜No. He had been ill for some time,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist, â€˜though I was surprised to hear it. He looked so very full of life.â€™ Mr Entwhistle said quickly, â€˜You saw him? When?â€™â€˜About three weeks ago. It was a surprise. Mrs Lansquenet hadnâ€™t expected him. It upset her. She said something like â€œPoor Richard. He sounds senile. All these silly ideas that someone is poisoning him. Old people get like that.â€ And of course, that is only too true. When my aunt got old, she thought the servants were trying to poison herl â€™not Mr Entwhistle was very worried. Richard Abernethie had  been senile.

This news about Cora has upset Timothy dreadfully - was it really murder? â€™ â€˜Yes,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.It seems incredible,â€™ said Maude. â€˜And I am very worried about Timothy. Itâ€™s so bad for him, all this. He insists that you come up here to Yorkshire and see him. He wants to know if Cora left a will.â€™â€˜There is a will. She left instructions for Timothy to be her executor but I will arrange everything. She left her own paintings and a piece of jewellery to her companion, Miss Gilchrist, and everything else to her niece, Susan.â€™â€˜To Susan? But why Susan?â€™â€˜Perhaps because she thought Susan had made a marriage that the family disapproved of. When all the bills are paid and the furniture is sold, I doubt Susan will get more than five hundred pounds. The inquest will be next Thursday. I will need Timothyâ€™s signature on certain documents as he is the executor, so I think it might be a good thing if I did come and see you.â€™â€˜That is wonderful! Tomorrow? And youâ€™ll stay the night? The best train is the 11.20 from St Pancras.â€™â€˜I will have to take an afternoon train, Iâ€™m afraid.

But knowing youâ€™ve inherited money certainly makes you feel lucky, so I went to the horse-races at Hurst Park. And I placed bets on two horses that won. I only made fifty pounds, but it all helps pay the bills.â€™ â€˜Oh yes,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜And there will now be additional money coming to you as a result of your Aunt Coraâ€™s death.â€™â€˜Poor old girl,â€™ George said. â€˜It does seem bad luck, doesnâ€™t it? I expect the police will question all the strange characters in the neighbourhood and make them prove where they were when the murder happened.â€™â€˜Not so easy if a little time has passed,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I was in a bookshop at half past three on that day. But would I remember that if I was questioned in ten daysâ€™ time? Would you remember which day you went to the races in â€” say â€” a monthâ€™s time?â€™â€˜Oh, I would remember because it was the day after the funeral.â€™â€˜True - true. And then you bet on two winning horses. You wouldnâ€™t forget that! Which were they, by the way?â€™â€˜Gaymarck and Frogg II.

And I said it must be. Two murders, one after another! â€™â€˜Donâ€™t be silly, Rosamund,â€™ said Michael. â€˜Your Uncle Richard wasnâ€™t murdered.â€™â€˜Well, Cora thought he was.â€™Mr Entwhistle interrupted. â€˜You did come back to London after the funeral, didnâ€™t you? I ask because I phoned you the following day - several times in fact, and couldnâ€™t get an answer.â€™ â€˜Oh dear. We were here until about twelve, and then Michael went to lunch with someone. I had a lovely afternoon shopping â€” and then we had dinner at a Spanish restaurant.

She left it to your cousin Susan.â€™â€˜Why Susan? Is it much?â€™â€˜A few hundred pounds and some furniture.â€™â€˜Nice furniture?â€™â€˜No,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.Rosamund lost interest. â€˜Itâ€™s all very strange, isnâ€™t it?â€™ she said. â€˜There was Cora, after the funeral, suddenly saying, â€œHe was murdered! â€ and then, the very next day, she is murdered?

In many ways she reminded him of her uncle, Richard Abernethie. She had the same energy he had. And yet Richard Abernethie had left her no more than the others. The reason must be because he didnâ€™t like her husband.Mr Entwhistle looked at Gregory Banks, a thin, pale young man with reddish hair. He was quite pleasant, and yet there was something about him that made Mr Entwhistle uneasy. What had attracted Susan to him? It was obvious that her world revolved around her husband.â€˜Have they any idea at all who the murderer might be?â€™ Susan asked.â€˜They wouldnâ€™t tell me if they did - and the murder took place only the day before yesterday,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.19]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "25">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieâ€˜Itâ€™s definitely got to be a certain kind of person,â€™ Susan was thoughtful. â€˜Someone violent, perhaps insane - I mean, to use a hatchet like that.

What do you mean - saying things like that? â€™â€˜Just my little joke,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle apologetically. â€˜Cora left her estate to you, Susan. But nobody can suggest than an estate of a few hundred pounds at the most is a motive for murder, for a young lady who has just inherited several hundred thousand pounds from her uncle.â€™â€˜She left her estate to me?â€™ Susan sounded surprised. â€˜How extraordinary. She didnâ€™t even know me!â€™â€˜I think she had heard rumours that there had been a little difficulty - er - over your marriage. There had been a certain amount of trouble over her own marriage - and I think she felt you were alike.â€™â€˜She married an artist, didnâ€™t she?

I may have to pay a deposit.â€™â€˜I can arrange that,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I telephoned you the day after the funeral several times - but could get no answer.

In fact, it broke down when I was coming back after the funeral. I had to walk a couple of miles to the nearest garage and stay at a small hotel while they fixed it and that upset Timothy. I try to keep things from him as much as possible - but some things I canâ€™t do anything about - Coraâ€™s murder, for instance. I had to ask Dr Barton to give him something to calm him down. It seems so strange for someone to break in and murder her in the middle of the afternoon. If you broke into a house, surely youâ€™d do it at night - and there must have been times during the day when both Cora and her companion were out and the house was empty. It doesnâ€™t make sense to commit a murder unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary.â€™Does murder ever make sense? It depended, Mr Entwhistle thought, on the mind of the murderer.They arrived at a very large house which badly needed painting.â€˜We have no servants,â€™ said Maude slightly angrily as she led the way in. â€˜Just a couple of women who come in every morning. If I have to go out in the afternoon, Timothy is completely alone.â€™ Maude led the way into the sitting room where she had already put tea things by the fireplace, and seating Mr Entwhistle there, disappeared. She returned in a few minutesâ€™ with a teapot and homemade cake.Looking at Maude in the light of the fire, Mr Entwhistle suddenly felt sad. Maude Abernethie had not had any children but she was a woman built for motherhood. Her hypochondriac husband had become her child, to be guarded and watched over.22]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "28">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralPoor Maude, thought Mr Entwhistle.? ? ?â€˜It is good of you to come, Entwhistle.â€™ Timothy raised himself up in his chair as he held out a hand. â€˜I mustnâ€™t do too much,â€™ he said. â€˜The doctorâ€™s forbidden it. Youâ€™ll have to do everything for me, Entwhistle. I canâ€™t go to the inquest or be bothered by business of any kind connected with Coraâ€™s estate. What happens to Coraâ€™s share of Richardâ€™s money? It comes to me, I suppose?â€™ Saying something about preparing dinner, Maude left the room.â€˜The sum left invested for Cora,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜goes equally to you and George, Rosamund and Susan.â€™â€˜But Iâ€™m her only surviving brother! I couldnâ€™t believe it when Maude came home and told me about Richardâ€™s will. I thought sheâ€™d made a mistake. She is the best woman in the world, Maude - but women donâ€™t understand money. I donâ€™t believe she even realises that if Richard hadnâ€™t died when he did, we might have had to leave our home here. That is a fact!â€™â€˜Surely if you had asked Richard . . .â€™Timothy gave a short laugh. â€˜I did say once to Richard that this place was getting a bit expensive to run and he said that we would be much better off in a smaller place altogether. It would be easier for Maude, he said! Oh no, I wouldnâ€™t have asked Richard for help. But I can tell you, Entwhistle, that the worry affected my health badly. Then Richard died and I felt so relieved about the future. But what hurt me was how Richard left his money. I assumed that he would leave everything to me. He came here - not long after Mortimerâ€™s death - because he wanted to talk about the family. We discussed young George - and Rosamund and Susan and their husbands. Both of those23]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "29">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christiegirls have made bad marriages, if you ask me. Well, I thought Richard was asking for my advice because I would be head of the family after he died, and so I thought the control of the money would be mine.â€™In his excitement Timothy had kicked aside the blanket that covered his legs and sat up straight in his chair. He looked, Mr Entwhistle thought, a perfectly healthy man.â€˜Will you have a drink, Entwhistle?â€™â€˜Not quite so soon. Maude has just given me an excellent tea.â€™ Timothy looked at him. â€˜Sheâ€™s a capable woman. Maude. She even fixes that old car of ours â€” sheâ€™s a good mechanic in her way, you know.â€™â€˜Yes, I hear the car broke down coming back from the funeral. Timothy, I donâ€™t know how much Maude told you about the funeral and the relatives. Cora said that Richard had been murdered. Perhaps Maude told you.â€™Timothy laughed. â€˜Thatâ€™s just the sort of thing Cora would say!â€™Maude came into the room and said firmly, â€˜I think, Timothy dear, that Mr Entwhistle has been with you long enough. You really must rest. If you have arranged everything . . .â€™â€˜Oh, weâ€™ve arranged things. Iâ€™ll leave it all to you, Entwhistle. Youâ€™ll see to Coraâ€™s funeral - wonâ€™t you?

On one side of the room a table was laid for two.Poirot said, â€˜You are welcome, mon ami. I returned from the country this morning. And you have something you wish to discuss with me?â€™â€˜Yes. Itâ€™s a long story, Iâ€™m afraid.â€™â€˜Then we will not have it until after we have eaten. Georges?â€™ Poirotâ€™s manservant, Georges, came in immediately with some pate de foie gras and hot toast.â€˜We will have our pate by the fire,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜Afterwards we will move to the table . . .â€™It was an hour and a half later that Mr Entwhistle sighed happily. â€˜You certainly know how to eat well, Poirot.â€™â€˜At my age, the main pleasure, almost the only pleasure that still remains, is the pleasure of the table,â€™ the Belgian detective said.A very good port was now by Mr Entwhistleâ€™s side. Poirot had a sweet liqueur.â€˜I donâ€™t know,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜whether Iâ€™m making a fool of myself. But Iâ€™m going to put the facts before you, and then Iâ€™d like to know what you think.â€™He paused for a moment or two, then he started speaking again. He told the story clearly, which was appreciated by the little man with the egg-shaped head who sat listening to him.When Entwhistle had finished there was a pause. Then Hercule Poirot said at last, â€˜It seems very clear. You have in your mind the suspicion that your friend, Richard Abernethie may have been murdered?

The fact that she herself was murdered the day afterwards may be a coincidence. It is true that Richard Abernethie died suddenly, but he was being seen by a doctor who had no suspicions. Was Richard buried or cremated? â€™ â€˜Cremated â€” at his own request.â€™â€˜So we come back to the essential point: what Cora Lansquenet said. And the real point is â€” that you believe she was speaking the truth.â€™â€˜Yes, I do,â€™ replied Mr Entwhistleâ€˜Why? Is it because already you had an uneasiness about the way Richardâ€™s death happened?â€™The lawyer shook his head. â€˜No, no, it isnâ€™t that.â€™â€˜Then it is because of her â€” of Cora herself. You knew her well?â€™â€˜I had not seen her for â€” oh â€” over thirty years.â€™â€˜Would you have known her if you had met her in the street?â€™ Mr Entwhistle thought hard. â€˜I might have passed her by in the street without recognising her. But the moment I spoke to her face to face I would have recognised her. She wore her hair in the same way, and had a trick of looking up at you through her fringe, and she had a way of putting her head on one side and then suddenly saying something shocking. She had character, you see and character is always highly individual.â€™â€˜She was, in fact, the same Cora you had known years ago. And she still said shocking things!â€™ said Poirot. â€˜The shocking things she had said in the past â€” were they usually correct?â€™â€˜That was always the awkward thing about Cora. She spoke the truth when it would have been better not to.â€™And Cora was quite sure Richard had been murdered. So she must have had some reason for the belief. Now tell me â€” when she said6   2]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "32">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralwhat she did, everyone protested immediately - that is right? And she then became confused and said something like â€œBut I thought â€” from what he told me . .The lawyer nodded. â€˜I wish I could remember more clearly. But Iâ€™m fairly sure she used the words â€œhe told meâ€ or â€œhe said . .And then everyone spoke of something else. You can remember, looking back, no special expression on anyoneâ€™s face?â€™ Poirot continued his questioning.â€˜No.â€™â€˜And the very next day, Cora is killed â€” and you ask yourself, â€œWas she killed because what she had said was true?â€ Me, I think, mon cher. exactly as you thought - that there is a case for investigation. You have spoken of these matters to the police?â€™â€˜No. I represent the family, Poirot. And if Richard Abernethie was murdered, there seems only one way it could have been done.â€™â€˜By poison?â€™â€˜Exactly. And the body has been cremated. There is now no evidence available. But I, myself, must be sure about it. That is why, Poirot, I have come to you.â€™â€˜Who was in the house at the time of his death?â€™â€˜Lanscombe - an old butler who has been with him for years, a cook and a housemaid. If he was murdered, one of them must be the killer.â€™â€˜Ah no! This Cora, she knows Richard Abernethie was killed, yet she agrees to keeping it quiet. Therefore it must be one of the family who is responsible. But we shall never be able to prove anything in the case of Richard Abernethie. However, the murder of Cora Lansquenet is different. Once we know â€œwhoâ€ then it should be possible to get the evidence we need.

In which case, Cora would have been wrong and her own death must have been done by a criminal who broke in. After all, it is simple. What were the members of the Abernethie family doing on the afternoon that Cora Lansquenet was killed? â€™â€˜Eh bien.â€™ said Poirot, â€˜what were they doing? â€™â€˜George Crossfield was at Hurst Park horse-races. Rosamund Shane was shopping in London. Her husband was at lunch discussing a play. Susan and Gregory Banks were at home all day. Timothy Abernethie was at his home in Yorkshire, and his wife was driving herself home from Enderby.â€™Hercule Poirot nodded. â€˜Yes, that is what they say. And is it all true?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know, Poirot. George may have been at Hurst Park races, but I do not think he was. He said that he had bet on a couple of winners. I asked him the names and both horses he named had, I found, been expected to win â€” but only one had.â€™ â€˜Interesting. Had this George any urgent need for money at the time of his uncleâ€™s death?â€™â€˜I have no evidence, but I suspect that he has been gambling with his clientsâ€™ money.â€™ He sighed. As for Rosamund, she is lovely, but not very intelligent. Her husband, Michael Shane, is a man with ambition. But I have no reason to suspect him of a violent crime. However, until I know that he really was doing what he says he was doing, I cannot take him off my list of suspects.â€™â€˜You have no doubts about Rosamund, the wife?â€™â€˜No â€” no â€” she is a delicate-looking creature.â€™â€˜And beautiful!â€™ said Poirot with a smile. â€˜And the other niece?â€™]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "34">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralâ€˜Susan? She is a girl of huge ability, I think. She and her husband were at home together that day. I said that I had tried to telephone them on the afternoon in question â€” I hadnâ€™t, of course. Greg said very quickly that the telephone had not been working all day.â€™â€˜So again there is no evidence . . . What is the husband like?â€™ â€˜He does not have a pleasing personality, though I cannot say exactly why. Susan has the mental strength and intelligence of Richard Abernethie. But I feel that she lacks the kindness and warmth of my old friend.â€™â€˜Women are never kind,â€™ remarked Poirot. â€˜Though they can sometimes be gentle. Does she love her husband? â€™â€˜She loves him almost too much, I would say.â€™â€˜Me, I am not so sentimental about beautiful young ladies! Now tell me about your visit to the older members of the Abernethie family.â€™Mr Entwhistle described his visit to Timothy and Maude and Poirot nodded.â€˜So Mrs Maude Abernethie is a good car mechanic. And Mr Timothy Abernethie is not the sick man he likes to think himself. He also resented his brotherâ€™s success. What about the sixth beneficiary? â€™â€˜Helen? I do not suspect her for a moment. Anyway, she was at Enderby. With three servants in the house.â€™â€˜Eh bien, my friend,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜What do you want me to do?â€™â€˜I want to know the truth, Poirot.

And I couldnâ€™t say exactly what it is.â€™â€˜You know the contents of the will?â€™â€˜Yes, Sir. Mrs Helen thought I would like to know. It seemed to me a very fair will.â€™â€˜Yes, but it is not, I think, the will that Mr Abernethie originally intended to make after his son died.â€™â€˜The Master, Sir, was very disappointed after Mr George had been here . . . Miss Susan he liked at once, but he didnâ€™t like her husband at all.â€™â€˜And the other couple?â€™â€˜I think the Master enjoyed having them here â€” but he never approved of acting as a job. He said to me one day, â€œItâ€™s a silly kind of life. It seems to me that actors and actresses live in a world of make-believe. Iâ€™m not sure it helps their judgment of what is right and what is wrong.â€ Of course he wasnâ€™t speaking directly.â€™32]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "38">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralâ€˜No, no, I understand. Now after these visits, Mr Abernethie himself went away - first to his brother, and afterwards to Mrs Lansquenet. Can you remember anything he said about those visits on his return? â€™â€˜The Master used to talk quietly to himself sometimes â€” thinking aloud â€” when I was in the room. He said something about not understanding what had happened to the money their father had left Timothy. And then he said something like, â€œWomen can be fools in ninety-nine different ways but not in the hundredth.â€ And â€œYou can only say what you really think to someone of your own generation. They donâ€™t think youâ€™re imagining things as the younger ones do.â€ And later he said â€œItâ€™s not very pleasant to have to set traps for people, but I donâ€™t see what else I can do.â€™â€Richard Abernethie had spoken of setting a trap. For whom?? ? ?Mr Entwhistle decided he should take Helen into his confidence. â€˜I am going to ask you if you could stay here until the house is sold,â€™ he said, â€˜but there is another reason why I would be grateful if you would stay on. There is a friend of mine, a man called Hercule Poirot â€”â€™Helen said sharply, â€˜Hercule Poirot? â€™â€˜You know of him?â€™â€˜Yes.â€™ Her face was white. â€˜You think - that Cora was right? That Richard was â€” murdered?â€™Mr Entwhistle told her everything. When he had finished she said, â€˜Maude and I, that night after the funeral - it was in both our minds, Iâ€™m sure. And then - Cora was killed - and I told myself it was just coincidence â€” but oh! If I could only be sure.]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "39">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha ChristieIâ€™ve been uneasy . . . Not just about what Cora said that day - something else.

She went unwillingly to the door, telling herself not to be so silly.A young woman dressed in black and carrying a small suitcase was standing on the step outside. She noticed the nervous look on Miss Gilchristâ€™s face and said quickly, â€˜Miss Gilchrist? I am Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s niece â€” Susan Banks.â€™â€˜Oh dear, yes, of course. Do come in, Mrs Banks. I didnâ€™t know you were coming down for the inquest. I would have had something ready â€” coffee or tea.â€™Susan Banks said quickly, â€˜I donâ€™t want anything. Iâ€™m so sorry if I frightened you.â€™â€˜Well, Iâ€™m not usually nervous, but - perhaps itâ€™s just the inquest â€” I have been nervous all this morning. Half an hour ago the bell rang and I was almost too afraid to open the door â€” which was really very stupid as it is so unlikely that a murderer would come back - and it was only a nun, collecting for an orphanage. Did you come here by train? â€™â€˜No, I came by car. I thought the road was too narrow to park outside so I drove the car on a little way past the cottage and found an old quarry and parked there.â€™Susan Banks looked round the sitting room with interest. â€˜Poor Aunt Cora. She left what she had to me, you know.â€™â€˜Yes, I know. I expect youâ€™ll need the furniture. Youâ€™re newly married, I understand.â€™â€˜I donâ€™t want any of it,â€™ Susan said. â€˜I will sell it. Unless â€” is there any of it you would like? Iâ€™d be very happy . . .â€™ She stopped, a little embarrassed.

I had a small tearoom at one time, you know - then the war came . . . But I didnâ€™t sell everything, because I did hope to have my own little home again one day, so I put the best things in store with my fatherâ€™s pictures. But I would like very much, if you really wouldnâ€™t mind, to have that little painted tea table. Such a pretty thing and we always had tea on it.â€™Susan, looking at what she thought was an ugly green table painted with large purple flowers, said that she would be delighted for Miss Gilchrist to have it.â€˜Thank you very much, Mrs Banks. I imagine you would like to look through her things? After the inquest, perhaps?â€™ Miss Gilchrist asked.â€˜I thought Iâ€™d stay here a couple of days and clear everything up.â€™ â€˜Sleep here, you mean?â€™â€˜Yes. Is there any difficulty?â€™â€˜Oh no, Iâ€™ll put fresh sheets on my bed, and I can sleep down here on the couch.â€™â€˜But thereâ€™s Aunt Coraâ€™s room, isnâ€™t there? I can sleep in that.â€™ â€˜You - you wouldnâ€™t mind? â€™â€˜You mean because she was murdered there? Oh no. Iâ€™m very practical, Miss Gilchrist. Itâ€™s been - I mean - itâ€™s been cleaned?â€™ â€˜Oh yes, Mrs Banks. All the blankets were sent away to the laundry and the whole room was cleaned thoroughly.â€™She led the way upstairs. The room where Cora Lansquenet had died was clean and fresh and had no sinister atmosphere. Over the fireplace an oil painting showed a young woman about to enter her bath.Susan gave a slight shudder as she looked at it and Miss Gilchrist said, â€˜That was painted by Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s husband. There are a lot more of his pictures in the dining room.â€™36]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "42">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralâ€˜How terrible! Where are Aunt Coraâ€™s own pictures?â€™â€˜In my room. Would you like to see them?â€™Miss Gilchrist proudly showed her the paintings.Susan commented that it looked like Aunt Cora was very fond of villages by the sea and that perhaps her paintings, which were very detailed and very brightly coloured, might have been painted from picture postcards.But Miss Gilchrist was indignant. Mrs Lansquenet always painted from nature!â€˜Mrs Lansquenet was a real artist,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist sharply. She looked at her watch and Susan said quickly, â€˜Yes, we ought to leave for the inquest. Is it far? Shall I get the car?â€™It was only five minutesâ€™ walk, Miss Gilchrist said, so they left together on foot. Mr Entwhistle, who had travelled by train, met them at the Village Hall.At the inquest, the dead woman was identified. It was said that death was unlikely to have occurred later than four-thirty. Miss Gilchrist testified to finding the body. A police constable and Inspector Morton gave their evidence and the jury was quick to reach the verdict: Murder by some person or persons unknown.Afterwards, when they came out again into the sunlight, half a dozen newspaper cameras clicked. Mr Entwhistle took them into the Kingâ€™s Arms pub for lunch in a private room. He said to Susan, â€˜I had no idea you were coming down today, Susan. We could have come together. Did your husband come with you?â€™â€˜Greg had some important things to do. Weâ€™ve got great plans for the future - we are going to open a beauty salon, which I will run, and a laboratory where Greg can make face creams.â€™Mr Entwhistleâ€™s mind went to other things. When Susan had spoken to him twice without his answering, he apologized.37]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "43">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieâ€˜Forgive me, my dear, I was thinking about your Uncle Timothy. I am a little worried.â€™â€˜I wouldnâ€™t worry. Uncle Timothy is not ill at all - heâ€™s just a hypochondriac.â€™â€˜It is not  his health that is worrying me. Itâ€™s Maudeâ€™s. Apparently she has fallen downstairs and broken her ankle. Sheâ€™s got to stay in bed and your uncle is terribly worried.â€™â€˜Because heâ€™ll have to look after her instead of the other way around? It will do him a lot of good,â€™ said Susan.â€˜Yes - yes, but will your poor aunt get any looking after?â€™ They came out of the Kingâ€™s Arms, rather warily but the newspaper reporters and photographers had gone.Mr Entwhistle took them back to the cottage then returned to the Kingâ€™s Arms where he had booked a room. The funeral was to be on the following day.â€˜My carâ€™s still in the quarry,â€™ said Susan when she and Miss Gilchrist had gone inside. â€˜Iâ€™ll go and get it and drive it along to the village later.â€™Miss Gilchrist said anxiously, â€˜You will do that in daylight, wonâ€™t you?â€™Susan laughed. â€˜You donâ€™t think the murderer is still nearby, do you?â€™â€˜No â€” no, I suppose not.â€™ Miss Gilchrist looked embarrassed. But itâ€™s exactly what she does think, thought Susan.Miss Gilchrist went towards the kitchen. â€˜Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d like tea, Mrs Banks!â€™Susan went into the sitting room. She had only been there a few minutes when the doorbell rang. Susan went to the front door and opened it. An elderly gentleman said, smiling, â€˜My name is Alexander Guthrie. I was a very old friend of Cora Lansquenetâ€™s. May I ask who you are?â€™38]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "44">     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeralâ€˜I am Susan Abernethie â€” well, Banks now since I married. Cora was my aunt. Please come in.â€™â€˜Thank you.â€™ Mr Guthrie followed Susan into the sitting room. â€˜This is a sad occasion,â€™ said Mr Guthrie. â€˜Yes, a very sad occasion. I felt the least I could do was to attend the inquest â€” and of course the funeral. I usually visited Cora once a year, and recently she had been buying pictures at local sales, and wanted me to look at some of them. I am an art critic, you know. Of course most of the paintings Cora bought were terrible; last year she wanted me to come and look at a Rembrandt she had bought. A Rembrandt! It wasnâ€™t even a good copy of one!â€™â€˜Like that one over there, I expect,â€™ said Susan, pointing to the wall behind him.Mr Guthrie got up and went over to study the picture. â€˜Poor dear Cora. Dirt,â€™ he said, â€˜is a wonderful thing, Mrs Banks! It gives a sort of romance to the most terrible paintings.â€™â€˜There are some more pictures in the dining room,â€™ said Susan, â€˜but I think they are all her husbandâ€™s work.â€™Mr Guthrie held up a hand. â€˜Do not make me look at those again. I always tried not to hurt Coraâ€™s feelings. A loving wife - a very loving wife. Well, dear Mrs Banks, I must not take up more of your time.â€™â€˜Oh, do stay and have some tea. I think itâ€™s nearly ready.â€™ â€˜That is very kind of you.â€™ Mr Guthrie sat down again.â€˜Iâ€™ll just go and see.â€™In the kitchen, Miss Gilchrist was lifting a tray from the oven. â€˜Thereâ€™s a Mr Guthrie here,â€™ Susan said. â€˜Iâ€™ve asked him to stay for tea.â€™â€˜Mr Guthrie? Oh, yes, he was a great friend of dear Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s. How lucky; Iâ€™ve made scones and thereâ€™s some homemade strawberry jam.â€™]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "45">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha ChristieSusan took in the tray and Miss Gilchrist, following with teapot and kettle, greeted Mr Guthrie.â€˜Hot scones, how lovely,â€™ said Mr Guthrie.Miss Gilchrist was delighted. The scones were excellent. The memory of the Willow Tree tearoom seemed to be in the room with them. Miss Gilchrist was clearly doing what she had been born to do.â€˜I do feel rather guilty,â€™ said Mr Guthrie, â€˜enjoying my tea here, where poor Cora was so horribly murdered.â€™Miss Gilchrist shook her head. â€˜No, no. Mrs Lansquenet would have wanted you to have a good tea.â€™â€˜Perhaps you are right. The fact is that itâ€™s difficult for me to accept that someone I knew - actually knew - has been murdered! And certainly not by some casual thief who broke in and attacked her. I can imagine, you know, reasons why Cora might have been murdered -â€™Susan said quickly, â€˜Can you? What reasons?â€™â€˜Well, if she knew a secret, she would always want to talk about it. Even if she promised not to, she would still do it. She couldnâ€™t stop herself. So a little poison in a cup of tea - that would not have surprised me. And I would have thought she had very little to take that would be worth it for a burglar. Ah! Well, thereâ€™s a lot of crime about since the war. Times have changed.â€™ Thanking them for the tea, he said goodbye. Miss Gilchrist took him to the door and came back into the room with a small parcel in her hand. â€˜The postman must have been while we were at the inquest. He must have pushed this through the letterbox and it fell in the corner behind the door.â€™Happily Miss Gilchrist tore off the paper. Inside was a small white box tied with silver ribbon. â€˜Itâ€™s wedding cake!â€™ She pulled off the ribbon.

Inside it was an elderly foreign gentleman with a large moustache.After supper, Susan questioned Miss Gilchrist about her uncleâ€™s visit to Cora.â€˜Did they get on well together?â€™â€˜Oh, yes. She did say that he had got very old â€” I think she said senile . . .â€™â€˜But you didnâ€™t think he was senile?â€™â€˜Well, not to look at. But I didnâ€™t talk to him much, I left them alone together.â€™Was Miss Gilchrist the kind of woman who listened at doors? She was honest, Susan felt sure, but. . .â€˜You didnâ€™t hear any of their conversation?â€™ Susan asked. â€˜Sometimes, in these small cottages, you canâ€™t avoid overhearing, and now that they are dead, itâ€™s really important to the family to know what was said at that meeting.â€™Miss Gilchrist nodded. â€˜I think they were talking about Mr Abernethieâ€™s health - and certain - well, ideas, he had. He blamed his ill-health on other people. A common thing, I believe, in the old. My aunt. . .â€™â€˜Yes,â€™ Susan interrupted, â€˜my uncleâ€™s servants were upset by his thinking ... It was the servants he suspected, I suppose? Of poisoning him, I mean?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know.

I do appreciate it. And you would say that I had been with a relation of yours and that I had - proved satisfactory?â€™â€˜Oh, of course.â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know whether I ought to ask it.â€™ Miss Gilchristâ€™s hands began to shake and she tried to steady her voice. â€˜But would it be possible not to - to mention what happened here - or even the name?â€™Susan stared. â€˜I donâ€™t understand.â€™â€˜Because itâ€™s murder. A murder thatâ€™s been in the papers and that everybody has read about. People might think, â€œTwo women living together, and one of them is killed â€” perhaps the companion did it.â€ Itâ€™s been worrying me terribly, Mrs Banks, thinking that perhaps Iâ€™ll never get another job â€” not of this kind. And what else is there that I can do?â€™Susan suddenly realized the desperation of this woman who was dependent on other peoplesâ€™ good opinion to get a job.

She had said she did not mind sleeping in this bed where Aunt Cora . . .No, no she must not think about that. Think ahead â€” her future and Gregâ€™s. The building in Cardigan Street â€” it was just what they wanted. They could have the beauty salon on the ground floor and live in the lovely flat upstairs. And there was a room out at the back for a laboratory for Greg. And Greg would get calm and well again. There would be no more of those huge angers; of those times when he looked at her without seeming to know who she was. Once or twice sheâ€™d been really frightened. And it would have happened again if Uncle Richard hadnâ€™t died just when he did.Uncle Richard had nothing to live for, so his death was a good thing, really. If only she could sleep. She always felt so safe in town â€” surrounded by people â€” never alone. Whereas here . . . Why did she feel that there was someone in this room, someone close beside her?Surely that was a groan? Someone in pain â€” someone dying! I mustnâ€™t imagine things, I mustnâ€™t, I mustnâ€™t, Susan whispered to herself. There it was again . . . someone groaning in great pain. This was real! The groans came from the room next door.Susan jumped out of bed and went into Miss Gilchristâ€™s room. She was sitting up in bed, her face twisted with pain. She tried to get out of bed but was very sick and then collapsed back on the pillows.â€˜Please â€” ring the doctor.

No tinned fish? Or sausages?â€™ â€˜No.â€™The ambulance came and took Miss Gilchrist away. The doctor went with her. When he had left, Susan went upstairs to bed.

I didnâ€™t have any of that, though she offered me some.â€™ Susan explained about the cake that had arrived.â€˜Strange. And you say she wasnâ€™t sure who sent it? Is there any of it left? Or is the box it came in still here somewhere?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know.â€™They found the white box in the kitchen with a few very small pieces of cake still in it.â€˜Iâ€™ll take this,â€™ the doctor said. â€˜Do you have any idea where the wrapping paper it came in might be?â€™ They looked but they did not find it.â€˜You wonâ€™t be leaving here just yet, Mrs Banks?â€™ His voice was friendly, but it made Susan feel a little uncomfortable. â€˜No, I will be here for a few days.â€™â€˜Good.

How you frightened me!â€™Her cousin smiled at her. â€˜So it seems.â€™â€˜How did you get here?â€™â€˜Well, the front door was open, so I walked in. There was nobody about on the ground floor, so I came up here. If you mean how did I get to this part of the world, I decided this morning to come to the funeral, but the car broke down, then seemed to start working again. I was too late for the funeral by then, but I thought I might as well continue the journey because I rang your flat and Greg told me youâ€™d come to sort things out.I thought I might help you.â€™Susan said, â€˜Can you take days off whenever you like?â€™â€˜A funeral has always been an acceptable excuse for taking a day off.

He canâ€™t be sure, though, so thereâ€™s a doubt about it.â€™â€˜But - whatâ€™s the alternative?â€™â€˜The alternative, Mrs Banks, is that an old piece of brown paper was used to wrap the parcel that already had Miss Gilchristâ€™s name and address on it and a used postage stamp. That package was then pushed through the letter box or put inside the door by hand to make her think that it had come by post. Itâ€™s a clever idea to choose wedding cake. Lonely middle-aged women are sentimental about wedding cake because they are so pleased to have been remembered by the young couple.â€™â€˜Was there enough poison in it to - kill? â€™â€˜That depends on whether Miss Gilchrist ate all of it. She thinks that she didnâ€™t, so Iâ€™d like to go upstairs if you donâ€™t mind, Mrs Banks.â€™â€˜Of course.â€™ She followed him up to Miss Gilchristâ€™s room and said, â€˜Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s in a terrible state. I didnâ€™t have time to clean up before the funeral and then after Dr Proctor came I thought perhaps I ought to leave it as it was.â€™â€˜That was very intelligent of you, Mrs Banks.â€™ He went to the bed and lifted the pillow. â€˜There you are,â€™ he said, smiling.A piece of wedding cake lay on the sheet.â€˜How extraordinary,â€™ said Susan.â€˜Oh no, itâ€™s not. Perhaps your generation doesnâ€™t do it. But itâ€™s an old custom. They say that if you put a piece of wedding cake under your pillow, youâ€™ll dream of your future husband.

Almost the only exception was Hercule Poirot: whose stomach was pleasantly rounded, his head looked like an egg in shape, and his moustache curved upwards flamboyantlyHe was looking thoughtfully at Mr Goby, who was small and thin. Mr Goby was famous for collecting information. Very few people knew about him and very few employed his services â€” but those few were usually extremely rich. They had to be, for Mr Goby was very expensive. His speciality was getting information â€” quickly. At a word from Mr Goby, hundreds of men and women, old and young, who worked for him, went out to question, investigate, and get results. Mr Goby had now almost retired from business. But he occasionally worked for a few old clients. Hercule Poirot was one of these.Mr Goby was not looking at Hercule Poirot because Mr Goby never looked directly at anybody. Right now he seemed to be talking to the fireplace. â€˜Iâ€™ve got what information I could for you. Nowadays you can walk in almost anywhere with a notebook and pencil and ask people all about their lives and they wonâ€™t doubt for a minute that you are working for the Government â€” and that the Government really wants to know! Yes, Government snooping is a gift to investigators and long may it continue!â€˜Now,â€™ said Mr Goby, and took out a little notebook and turned over the pages. â€˜Here we are. Mr George Crossfield. Heâ€™s been in debt for a while now. Heâ€™s been using money from his clientsâ€™ trust funds. For three months heâ€™s been worried and bad-tempered in the office. But since his uncleâ€™s death thatâ€™s all changed!]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "57">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieâ€˜What he said about being at Hurst Park races is almost certainly untrue. None of the people he usually places his bets with saw him. Nobody saw him in Lytchett St Mary either, but that doesnâ€™t mean he wasnâ€™t there. There are other ways to approach the cottage than through the village. He acted in plays at university, by the way. So if he went to the cottage that day, he could have used make up to change the way he looks. Iâ€™ll keep him in my book, shall I?â€™â€˜You may keep him in,â€™ said Hercule Poirot.Mr Goby turned another page. â€˜Mr Michael Shane. He likes money and is very attractive to women. Heâ€™s been having an affair with Sorrel Dainton, the actress, and his wife Rosamund doesnâ€™t know about it. She doesnâ€™t know much about anything, it seems. Sheâ€™s not a good actress, and is crazy about her husband.â€˜On the day Mr Shane says he was meeting a Mr Rosenheim and a Mr Oscar Lewis for lunch to discuss a play, he sent them a telegram to say he couldnâ€™t come. What he did do was to go to the Emeraldo Car people and hire a car at about twelve oâ€™clock. He returned it at about six in the evening. The car had been driven just about the right number of miles, but it was not seen in Lytchett St Mary that day. However, there are lots of places he could have left it hidden a mile or so away; thereâ€™s even an old quarry a few hundred yards down the road from the cottage. Do we keep Mr Shane in? â€™â€˜Most certainly.â€™â€˜Now  Mrs Shane.â€™ Mr Goby told his left sleeve about Rosamund Shane. â€˜She says she was shopping. And she had heard she had inherited money the day before.

Most ladies are tricked by that and say, â€œOh no, I was . . .â€ whatever it may be. But Mrs Shane just looked blank and said, â€œOh, maybe. I couldnâ€™t possibly remember.â€ What can you do with a lady like that? â€™ Mr Goby shook his head sadly.â€˜Nothing,â€™ said Hercule Poirot with some feeling. â€˜I shall never forget the killing of Lord Edgware. I was nearly defeated â€” yes, I, Hercule Poirot - by the extremely simple cleverness of an empty brain. Very simple-minded people often have the unexpected intelligence to commit a simple crime and then leave it alone.

But continue.â€™Once more Mr Goby looked at his little book. â€˜Mr and Mrs Banks said they were at home all day. Well, Susan Banks wasnâ€™t. She went round to the garage, got out her car, and drove off in it at about one oâ€™clock. We do not know where she went and she came back at about five. I have no idea how many miles she did that day because she drives every day and, unlike Michael Shaneâ€™s hired car, no one keeps a note of the mileage.â€˜As for Mr Gregory Banks, we donâ€™t know what he did. He didnâ€™t go to work and it seems he had already asked for a couple of days off because of the funeral. Since then heâ€™s left his job - where they do not like Mr Banks.

He had made some mistake with a medicine he made for a customer at the pharmacy he worked at then. The woman recovered, and there was no prosecution. The shop didnâ€™t sack him, but he resigned and told the doctor he was filled with guilt â€” that he had done it deliberately. He said that the woman had been rude to him when she came into the shop, and so he had added an almost lethal dose of some drug or other to her medicine. â€œShe had to be punished for speaking to me like that!â€ was what he said. The doctors donâ€™t believe it was deliberate at all, he was just careless, but they say that he wanted to make it important and serious. Anyway, this nursing home cured him and sent him home, and he met Susan Abernethie. He got the job heâ€™s just left and another pharmacist at the same shop said he had a very bad temper.â€™â€˜Mon ami,â€™ said Hercule Poirot. â€˜It really amazes me how you get your information!

She didnâ€™t come back to the hotel till late that evening.â€™â€˜And the times?â€™â€˜She got the sandwiches at eleven.

You have been most kind.â€™Janet left the room. These foreigners, she thought! The questions they asked. It was all very well for Mrs Helen Abernethie to say that Monsieur Pontarlier was a doctor who wanted to buy the house and was also interested in unsuspected heart conditions such as the one Mr Abernethie must have had. But what business was it of his to nose around asking questions about the medicines the Master had taken, and where they were kept! And asking if any of the medicines he took were still in the house. Of course they had all been thrown away.Poirot went downstairs in search of Lanscombe. It was quite clear to him that anybody could have got into the house on the day before Richard Abernethie died, and put poison into one of his medicines. Or someone could have put poison pills into the bottle next to his bed where his sleeping pills were. This was more likely.The front door was kept locked at all times, but there was a side door that led to the garden which was not locked until the evening. At about quarter-past one, when the gardeners had gone to lunch and when the household was in the dining room or kitchen, Poirot had entered the grounds through the main gate, walked through the garden to the side door, and gone up the stairs to Richard Abernethieâ€™s bedroom without meeting anybody.Yes, it could have been done. But the murder â€” if it was murder â€” of Richard Abernethie could never be proved. It was Cora Lansquenetâ€™s murder for which evidence was needed.

The cottage is not needed for the U.N.A.R.C.O guests and the people who will look after them.â€™â€˜Well, thank you, Sir. Most of the guests would be foreigners, wouldnâ€™t they?â€™â€˜Yes. Amongst those who came from Europe to this country before and during the war are several who are old and unwell. The organization I work for has raised money to buy country homes for them.

But I did not expect to do so. Now tell me, Madame, of those at Mr Richard Abernethieâ€™s funeral, who knew Cora best?â€™â€˜Lanscombe. He remembers her from when she was a child.

And you want the truth, Mr Entwhistle tells me?â€™Helen said with a sigh, â€˜Richard was disappointed in the younger generation.

I think that anything you do, you would manage to do with perfection.â€™â€˜Thank you, Monsieur. I think this would look good on that green marble table.â€™There was a bouquet of wax flowers under a glass shade on the table.

Ah!â€™The shade had slipped from Helenâ€™s fingers. It dropped on the floor and broke.â€˜How careless of me. However, I can get a new glass shade.

And yet could not exactly say why? Had anything particular happened that day? â€™ he asked.â€˜Oh, I donâ€™t think so. It seems to have started when she left Lytchett St Mary, or so she said. She didnâ€™t seem to mind being alone when she was there.â€™And the result, Poirot thought, had been a piece of poisoned wedding cake. Not very surprising that Miss Gilchrist was frightened after that. . . But something in Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house had made Miss Gilchrist afraid. What?Finding himself alone with Miss Gilchrist for a few minutes before dinner, Poirot had raised the subject. â€˜It would be impossible for me to mention the matter of murder to members of the family. But I am fascinated. It was such a violent crime - to attack a sensitive artist in a lonely cottage. Terrible for her family. But terrible, also, for you. Since Mrs Maude Abernethie says that you were there at the time?â€™â€˜Yes, I was. And if youâ€™ll excuse me, Monsieur Pontarlier, I donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€™â€˜I understand completely.â€™Poirot waited.

No one answered when they knocked and rang â€” Mrs Lansquenet was at the Abernethie funeral and Gilchrist had gone out for the day. The point is that they say they heard sighs and groans from inside the cottage. So was there someone there? And if so, who?

Let me first, go over the various points which were brought to my attention by the excellent Mr Entwhistle.â€˜First, Mr Richard Abernethie dies suddenly. Secondly, after his funeral, his sister Cora Lansquenet says, â€œHe was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€ Thirdly Mrs Lansquenet is killed. Then Miss Gilchrist becomes ill after eating a piece of wedding cake, which was poisoned with arsenic. That is the next step in the sequence.â€˜I have found nothing to prove that Mr Abernethie was poisoned. Equally, I have found nothing to prove that he was not. But Cora Lansquenet undoubtedly asked that shocking question. And undoubtedly Mrs Lansquenet was murdered. Now, the post van driver strongly believes that he did not deliver that wedding cake. If that is so, then the parcel was left by hand and though we cannot exclude a â€œperson unknownâ€ â€” we must consider those people who were able to put the parcel where it was found. Those were: Miss Gilchrist herself, of course; Susan Banks; Mr Entwhistle and Mr Guthrie, an art critic; and a nun or nuns who called to collect money.â€˜Miss Gilchrist did not benefit by Richard Abernethieâ€™s death and in only a very small way by the death of Mrs Lansquenet â€” and Miss Gilchrist was taken to hospital with arsenic poisoning.â€˜Susan Banks did benefit from Richard Abernethieâ€™s death, and in a small way from Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s. She might have believed that Miss Gilchrist had overheard a conversation between Cora Lansquenet and Richard Abernethie which referred to her. Because of that she might have decided that Miss Gilchrist must be killed. She did, after all, refuse to eat the wedding cake.93]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "99">     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christieâ€˜Mr Entwhistle did not benefit by either of the deaths - but he did have considerable control over Mr Abernethieâ€™s affairs, and there could easily be some reason why Richard Abernethie should not live too long. But â€” you will say â€” if it is Mr Entwhistle who was worried, why should he come to me?And that I will answer â€” it is not the first time that a murderer has been too sure of himself.â€˜We now come to Mr Guthrie. If Mr Guthrie is really Mr Guthrie, the art critic, then that clears him. The same is true for the nun, if she is really a nun. The question is: are these people themselves, or are they somebody else?And there seems to be a strange â€” pattern â€” one might call it â€” of a nun all through this business. A nun comes to the door of Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house and Miss Gilchrist believes it is the same nun she has seen at Coraâ€™s house. Also a nun, or nuns, called here the day before Mr Abernethie died.â€˜Other features of the case caught my attention: the visit of an art critic, a smell of oil paint, a picture postcard of Polflexan harbour, and finally a bouquet of wax flowers.â€˜It was thinking about these things that led me to the truth. Richard Abernethie died suddenly â€” but there would have been no reason to suspect murder if it had not been for the words said by his sister Cora at his funeral. You all believed them because Cora Lansquenet had always been famous for speaking the truth at difficult moments.â€˜And now I come to the question that I suddenly asked myself: How well did you all know Cora Lansquenet? And Not well at all is the answer! There were actually only three people present that day who really knew Cora. Lanscombe, the butler, who is old and almost blind; Mrs Maude Abernethie who had only seen her a few times round about the date of her own wedding; and94]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "100">     <text><![CDATA[After the FuneralMrs Helen Abernethie who had not seen her for over thirty years.â€˜So I said to myself: â€œSupposing it was not Cora Lansquenet who came to the funeral that day?â€™â€â€˜Do you mean that it wasnâ€™t Aunt Cora who was murdered, but someone else?â€™ Susan demanded.â€˜No, no, it was Cora Lansquenet who was murdered. But it was not Cora Lansquenet who came to the funeral. The woman who came that day came for one purpose only â€” to create in the minds of his relations the idea that Richard Abernethie had been murdered!â€™â€˜Why? What was the point of it? â€™ Maude asked.â€˜To draw attention away from the murder of Cora Lansquenet herself For if Cora says that Richard has been murdered, and the next day she herself is killed, then her death will be believed to be the result of what she said. But if Cora had simply been murdered without making her comment about Richardâ€™s death, and if the â€œrobberyâ€ did not convince the police, then suspicion would be likely to fall on the woman who shared the house with her.â€™Miss Gilchrist protested, â€˜Oh really, you donâ€™t suggest Iâ€™d commit a murder for a piece of jewellery and a few worthless watercolours?â€™â€˜No,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜But one of those watercolours represented Polflexan harbour which, as Mrs Banks realized, had been copied from a picture postcard which showed the old pier still in position. Yet Mrs Lansquenet painted always from life. Mr Entwhistle had mentioned there being a smell of oil paint in the cottage. You can paint, canâ€™t you, Miss Gilchrist? And you had been painting over another picture. You know a lot about painting. Supposing that one of the pictures that Cora bought at a sale was a really valuable one.

You knew she was expecting a visit from a well-known art critic. Then her brother died suddenly â€” and a plan comes into your head. It was easy to put a sleeping drug in her morning tea that would keep her unconscious for the whole of the day of the funeral whilst you played her part at Enderby. She talked a lot about her childhood days so it was easy for you to â€œrememberâ€ incidents and objects. You were wearing Coraâ€™s clothes, with padding to make you look larger, and a false fringe. And Cora had certain mannerisms, all of which you had practised carefully before a mirror.â€˜But you forgot that a mirror image is reversed. When you saw in the glass the perfect reproduction of Coraâ€™s sideways movement of the head, you didnâ€™t realize that it was actually the wrong way round. You saw Cora tilting her head to the right â€” but your own head was tilted to the left to produce that effect in the mirror.â€˜That was what puzzled Helen Abernethie at the moment when you asked your famous question. Something seemed to her â€œwrongâ€. I realized myself the other night when Rosamund Shane made an unexpected comment about what happens on such an occasion. Everybody looks at the speaker. After the talk about mirror images, I think Helen Abernethie experimented before her mirror. She probably thought of Cora, remembered how Cora used to tilt her head to the right, did so, and looked in the mirror â€” when, of course, she realized just what had been wrong on the day of the funeral. She was determined to tell Mr Entwhistle of her discovery as soon as she woke next morning. But someone who was used to getting up early followed her downstairs and hit her on the head.â€˜I may as well tell you now that Mrs Abernethie is not seriously ill.

What he actually told her, no doubt, was the fact that he had not long to live, and that explains a phrase in the letter he wrote to her after getting home. The â€œnunâ€ was another of your suggestions. The nuns who called at the cottage on the day of the inquest suggested to you a mention of a nun who was â€œfollowing you roundâ€, and you used that when you were anxious to hear what Maude Abernethie was saying to her sister-in-law at Enderby. And also because you wished to go with her there and find out for yourself just what suspicions there were. To poison yourself, badly but not fatally, with arsenic, is a very old trick- and made Inspector Morton suspicious of you.â€™â€˜But the picture?â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜What was it?â€™Poirot slowly unfolded a telegram. â€˜This morning Mr Entwhistle went to Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house to look among the pictures in Miss Gilchristâ€™s room. He was to take the one of Polflexan Harbour to London and go to Mr Guthrie whom I had contacted by telegram. The hastily painted sketch of Polflexan was removed from the surface and the original picture was exposed.â€™He held up the telegram and read:â€˜Definitely a Vermeer. Guthrie.â€™Suddenly, Miss Gilchrist spoke. â€˜I knew it was a Vermeer. She didnâ€™t know! She was always talking about Enderby, and what they did there as children.

It wasn&apos;t unusual for servants, like the old butler Lanscombe, to receive a sum of money to thank them for their loyal service. Wills were usually made in a solicitorâ€™s office but not always. To be legal, the signing of the will had to be witnessed, i.e. seen, by two people (usually not relatives) who knew the person writing the will. In addition to the two witnesses there had to be an executor. The executor was the person chosen by the person making the will to make sure that their wishes were carried out properly Quite often the solicitor would be named as the executor, but it wasnâ€™t unusual for a family member, like Timothy, Richard Abernethieâ€™s brother, to be named.TearoomsToday&apos;s coffee shop or cafe, selling Italian or American coffee and pastries, had not, at the time of the story (early 1950s), come to Britain. Tearooms, however, were very common everywhere. People would go to them to drink good quality tea and eat homemade cakes, sandwiches and scones. They were highly respectable places and the customers were usually middle and upper class women who had been out shopping. Before the war, a lot of the food people ate in Britain was sent in from other countries by ship. When the war started, this was no longer possible because the boats that usually brought the food were attacked and destroyed and the food did not arrive.The government had to make sure that there was enough food, not only for the people in Britain, but also for the soldiers fighting in the war. They did this by controlling how much food each person could buy every104]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "110">     <text><![CDATA[Cultural notesweek. This was called rationing and most items of food, for example, meat, butter, eggs, tea, biscuits, fruit, sugar and chocolate were rationed. Food rationing lasted until 1954.InquestsIf a death has been caused by anything other than natural causes, for example, a heart attack or long illness (as with Richard Abernethie) an inquest must be held. This is a public inquiry with a jury of twelve ordinary people, and a coroner, who is in charge at the inquest. Everybody, including members of the public, listen to the evidence. The jury then give their verdict and say what the cause of death was, for example, natural death, accidental death, suicide or murder. In the case of murder, a police investigation then takes place.Post mortems, autopsiesIn the UK, when a person dies, a doctor has to certify the cause of death. If the doctor does not know exactly why the person died, and the death was sudden and rather suspicious, they have to do a post mortem, also called an autopsy. This is a medical examination done by a doctor called a pathologist, who removes the internal organs of the dead person and examines them to discover the cause of death. When Richard Abernethie died, it was decided that an autopsy was unnecessary because he had been ill. Later when there was some doubt about the cause of his death, an autopsy was impossible because his body had been cremated (see Glossary). With the murder of one of Richardâ€™s relatives later in the story, an autopsy was again not done because the cause of death was obvious - the victim had been violently attacked.]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "111">     <text><![CDATA[Cultural notesMonsieur PoirotPoirot is from Belgium and his first language is French, not English. His language is quite formal, which makes it sound â€˜foreignâ€™ to a native speaker. Sometimes Poirot says things that are not completely correct. The word order he uses may be wrong or he may use a word wrongly, for example, he may say good when he should have said well or the other way round. He often uses little French expressions like mort ami (my friend) or Eh bien (Oh well).Wedding cakeAt the time of the story, if you had been invited to a wedding but were unable to attend, it was usual for the couple getting married to send you a piece of their wedding cake in a small box.Trust fundA trust fund is an amount of money that belongs to someone but is managed by someone else, for example, if the person is too young or they are not considered responsible or knowledgeable enough to take care of it themselves. Quite often the money is invested and the person who owns it only receives the profits or interest, leaving the original amount safe. It is common for a solicitor to be the person who controls a trust fund. In the story, Richardâ€™s nephew George, who is a solicitor, is suspected of using money from his clientsâ€™ trust funds to gamble with at the horse races.RefugeesRefugees are people who have to leave their countries because of their political or religious beliefs. At the time this story was written, there were many refugees in Britain. Some were Jews who had left Eastern Europe during or before the Second World War, others had come as a result of the expansion of Communism in Eastern Europe after the war. Nobody would have thought it unusual for someone like Poirot to be representing an organization that helped refugees.]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "112">     <text><![CDATA[Cultural notesVermeerJohan Vermeer was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the seventeenth century (1632-1675) although his paintings did not become valuable until the nineteenth century.
