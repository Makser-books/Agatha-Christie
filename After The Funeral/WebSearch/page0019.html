Agatha Christieme that her brother had left her a very good income. Poor dear. Well, Iâ€™m glad she had the pleasure of planning.â€™ Miss Gilchrist sighed, â€˜I donâ€™t suppose I shall ever go to Italy now . . .â€™â€˜And the next morning? â€™ Mr Entwhistle asked.â€˜The next morning Mrs Lansquenet wasnâ€™t at all well. Sheâ€™d had almost no sleep at all, she told me, because of bad dreams. She had her breakfast in bed, and at lunchtime she told me that she still hadnâ€™t been able to sleep. â€œI keep thinking of things and wondering,â€ she said. And then she said that she would take some sleeping tablets and try and get a good sleep in the afternoon. She wanted me to go into town and change her library books. So I left just after two and that - and that - was the last time . . .â€™ Miss Gilchrist began to cry. â€˜She must have been asleep, you know, and the Inspector says that she didnâ€™t feel anything . . . And do tell her relations that apart from having such a bad night, she was really very happy and looking forward to the future.â€™â€˜She did not speak at all about her brotherâ€™s death? The â€” er â€” cause of it?â€™â€˜No. He had been ill for some time,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist, â€˜though I was surprised to hear it. He looked so very full of life.â€™ Mr Entwhistle said quickly, â€˜You saw him? When?â€™â€˜About three weeks ago. It was a surprise. Mrs Lansquenet hadnâ€™t expected him. It upset her. She said something like â€œPoor Richard. He sounds senile. All these silly ideas that someone is poisoning him. Old people get like that.â€ And of course, that is only too true. When my aunt got old, she thought the servants were trying to poison herl â€™not Mr Entwhistle was very worried. Richard Abernethie had  been senile. He asked whether Miss Gilchrist knew if Cora Lansquenet had left a will. She replied that Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s will was at the bank.H
