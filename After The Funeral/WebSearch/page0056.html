Chapter 12Two elderly men sat together in a room where everything was square. Almost the only exception was Hercule Poirot: whose stomach was pleasantly rounded, his head looked like an egg in shape, and his moustache curved upwards flamboyantlyHe was looking thoughtfully at Mr Goby, who was small and thin. Mr Goby was famous for collecting information. Very few people knew about him and very few employed his services â€” but those few were usually extremely rich. They had to be, for Mr Goby was very expensive. His speciality was getting information â€” quickly. At a word from Mr Goby, hundreds of men and women, old and young, who worked for him, went out to question, investigate, and get results. Mr Goby had now almost retired from business. But he occasionally worked for a few old clients. Hercule Poirot was one of these.Mr Goby was not looking at Hercule Poirot because Mr Goby never looked directly at anybody. Right now he seemed to be talking to the fireplace. â€˜Iâ€™ve got what information I could for you. Nowadays you can walk in almost anywhere with a notebook and pencil and ask people all about their lives and they wonâ€™t doubt for a minute that you are working for the Government â€” and that the Government really wants to know! Yes, Government snooping is a gift to investigators and long may it continue!â€˜Now,â€™ said Mr Goby, and took out a little notebook and turned over the pages. â€˜Here we are. Mr George Crossfield. Heâ€™s been in debt for a while now. Heâ€™s been using money from his clientsâ€™ trust funds. For three months heâ€™s been worried and bad-tempered in the office. But since his uncleâ€™s death thatâ€™s all changed!
