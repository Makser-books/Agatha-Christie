Agatha Christieago â€” just before he met his wife and joined this particular chemistâ€™s shop - he was in a nursing home as a patient. He had made some mistake with a medicine he made for a customer at the pharmacy he worked at then. The woman recovered, and there was no prosecution. The shop didnâ€™t sack him, but he resigned and told the doctor he was filled with guilt â€” that he had done it deliberately. He said that the woman had been rude to him when she came into the shop, and so he had added an almost lethal dose of some drug or other to her medicine. â€œShe had to be punished for speaking to me like that!â€ was what he said. The doctors donâ€™t believe it was deliberate at all, he was just careless, but they say that he wanted to make it important and serious. Anyway, this nursing home cured him and sent him home, and he met Susan Abernethie. He got the job heâ€™s just left and another pharmacist at the same shop said he had a very bad temper.â€™â€˜Mon ami,â€™ said Hercule Poirot. â€˜It really amazes me how you get your information! Medical and highly confidential most of it!â€™Mr Goby said, looking at the door, that there were ways . . . â€˜Now we come to Mr and Mrs Timothy Abernethie. They are very short of money. Mr Abernethie enjoys being ill and the emphasis is on the enjoyment. He has everyone fetching and carrying things for him because he says heâ€™s too ill to do anything for himself, but he eats large meals, and seems strong physically. Thereâ€™s no one in the house after the daily cleaning woman leaves, and she says he was in a very bad temper on the morning of the day after the funeral. He was alone in the house and nobody saw him from 9.30 that morning until the following morning.â€™â€˜And Mrs Maude Abernethie?â€™
