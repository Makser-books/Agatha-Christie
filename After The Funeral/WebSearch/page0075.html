Agatha ChristieBut Gregory Banks said nothing!Poirot had talked with Maude Abernethie, who said how fortunate it had been that Timothy was able to come to Enderby, and how kind it had been of Helen to invite Miss Gilchrist also.â€˜For she is most useful,â€™ Maude said. â€˜It was really fortunate that she was too scared to stay alone in our house, though I admit I was annoyed at the time.â€™â€˜Too scared?â€™Poirot listened whilst Maude explained.â€˜She was frightened, you say? And yet could not exactly say why? Had anything particular happened that day? â€™ he asked.â€˜Oh, I donâ€™t think so. It seems to have started when she left Lytchett St Mary, or so she said. She didnâ€™t seem to mind being alone when she was there.â€™And the result, Poirot thought, had been a piece of poisoned wedding cake. Not very surprising that Miss Gilchrist was frightened after that. . . But something in Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house had made Miss Gilchrist afraid. What?Finding himself alone with Miss Gilchrist for a few minutes before dinner, Poirot had raised the subject. â€˜It would be impossible for me to mention the matter of murder to members of the family. But I am fascinated. It was such a violent crime - to attack a sensitive artist in a lonely cottage. Terrible for her family. But terrible, also, for you. Since Mrs Maude Abernethie says that you were there at the time?â€™â€˜Yes, I was. And if youâ€™ll excuse me, Monsieur Pontarlier, I donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€™â€˜I understand completely.â€™Poirot waited. And, as he had thought, Miss Gilchrist immediately began to talk about it.
