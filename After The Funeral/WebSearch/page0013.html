Agatha ChristieNobody was listening. They were thinking about their own futures.â€˜Now I can put my clientsâ€™ money back in their accounts before they notice itâ€™s missing,â€™ thought George.Gregory thought, â€˜Now I can escape from this prison Iâ€™m in.â€™Susanâ€™s hard, young eyes softened as she looked at her husband. She suspected that Greg loved her less than she loved him â€” but that only strengthened her feelings. Greg was hers; she would do anything for him. Anything.? ? ?Maude Abernethie, who was staying the night at Enderby, wondered if she should offer to stay longer to help Helen with the clearing of the house. But she really had to get back to Timothy to look after him. He had expected that most of Richardâ€™s fortune would come to him and he would be annoyed - and that was so bad for his health.She sighed, then smiled. Things were going to be much easier now, financially. They could spend money on plants for the garden, for instance.? ? ?Helen Abernethie sat by the fire in the sitting room at Enderby Hall. How worried she had been lately about money. Now, thanks to Richard, all that was over.Helen looked at the bouquet of wax flowers that stood on the green marble table. Cora had been sitting beside it when they had been waiting to go to the funeral. She had been so pleased at being back in her old home. Oh, but the way Cora had asked, â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™The faces all round, shocked, staring at her!
