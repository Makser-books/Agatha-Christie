Chapter 3As he returned south to London by train, Mr Entwhistle thought about what Cora had said, and how everyone had reacted. Maude had exclaimed, â€˜Really, Cora!â€™Somebody else had said, â€˜What do you mean?â€™And at once Cora had said, â€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t mean - oh, but I did think from what he said - and his death was so sudden! Oh, please forget that I said anything at all â€” I know Iâ€™m always saying the wrong thing.â€™And then there had been a discussion about Richard Abernethieâ€™s personal belongings. The house and its contents, Mr Entwhistle said, would be sold.Coraâ€™s unfortunate comment had been forgotten. After all, Cora had always been, if not subnormal, embarrassingly naive. She had always said unwelcome truths.Mr Entwhistleâ€™s thoughts stopped there. Yes, it was because Coraâ€™s comments were true, that they were so embarrassing!When Mr Entwhistle had looked at Cora earlier, she had not looked like the girl he had known. But Coraâ€™s mannerisms were still there - such as the way she tilted her head to one side as she spoke. He remembered two phrases now.â€˜But I did think from what he said . . .â€™ and â€˜His death was so sudden.â€™Yes, Richardâ€™s death had been sudden. Richardâ€™s doctor had said only months ago that if Richard looked after himself, he might live two or three years. Perhaps longer.Well, doctors could never be sure about how each patient would react to a disease. And Richard Abernethie had no great wish to live after his son Mortimerâ€™s death because there was no child or grandchild of his to inherit his fortune and his business.6
