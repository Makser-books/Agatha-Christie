Agatha Christiefuneral by watching and talking to them, and then make his own conclusions about them.â€˜Yes, Sir?â€™ Lanscombe said politely.â€˜Mrs Abernethie tells me that you had hoped to live in the cottage by the gates when you retired?â€™â€˜That is so, Sir. Naturally all that is changed now. When . . .â€™ Poirot interrupted, â€˜It might still be possible. The cottage is not needed for the U.N.A.R.C.O guests and the people who will look after them.â€™â€˜Well, thank you, Sir. Most of the guests would be foreigners, wouldnâ€™t they?â€™â€˜Yes. Amongst those who came from Europe to this country before and during the war are several who are old and unwell. The organization I work for has raised money to buy country homes for them. This place is, I think, very suitable.â€™Lanscombe sighed. â€˜IfEnderby Hall has to be sold, Iâ€™m pleased to think that itâ€™s going to be the kind of place youâ€™re talking about. Weâ€™ve always welcomed the unfortunate in this country, Sir; it has always been something to be proud of.â€™â€˜Thank you, Lanscombe,â€™ said Poirot gently. â€˜Your Masterâ€™s death must have been a great shock to you.â€™â€˜It was, Sir. No one could have had a better Master.â€™â€˜I have been talking with my friend and â€” er â€” colleague, Dr Larraby. We were wondering if your Master could have had an unpleasant interview on the day before he died? You do not remember if any visitors came to the house that day?â€™â€˜Some nuns called, collecting money for sick children â€” and a young man came to the back door to sell some brushes. Nobody else.â€™Poirot went to see Marjorie, the cook, and had no difficulty in finding out exactly what had been served at dinner the night
