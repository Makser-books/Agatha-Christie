Agatha Christieninety, and half blind. Well, heâ€™ll have that nice little inheritance from Richard.â€™Leo Abernethieâ€™s widow. Helen, he knew well. She was a very charming woman of fifty-one. It was strange that she had never married again after Leoâ€™s death, he thought.Mr Entwhistle moved his attention on to George Crossfield, Laura Abernethieâ€™s son. Laura had left very little money when she died five years ago. George was a lawyer and a handsome young man - but there was a dishonest feel about him.Now which of the two young women was which? Ah yes, that was Rosamund, Geraldineâ€™s daughter, looking at the wax flowers on the green marble table. She was a beautiful girl, but silly. She was an actress, not a very good one, and she had married an actor, Michael Shane, fair-haired and handsome. And he knows he is, thought Mr Entwhistle.Susan, the late Gordon Abernethieâ€™s daughter, would be much better on the stage than Rosamund, Mr Entwhistle thought - she had far more personality. She also had dark hair and eyes that were almost golden in colour. Beside her was Gregory Banks, the man she had just married. He was a pharmacistâ€™s assistant! In Mr Entwhistleâ€™s world, girls did not marry men who worked in a shop. The young man, who had a pale face, seemed uncomfortable.His eyes went on to Mrs Maude Abernethie. A big, sensible woman, she had always been a good wife to Timothy, who had been an invalid for many years. Mr Entwhistle suspected that Timothy only imagined that he was ill, that he was a hypochondriac, in fact.Then Mr Entwhistle looked next at Cora Lansquenet. Her mother had died giving birth to her. Poor little Cora! She was an awkward girl, always saying the wrong thing. She met Pierre
