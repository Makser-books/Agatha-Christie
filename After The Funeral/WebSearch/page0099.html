Agatha Christieâ€˜Mr Entwhistle did not benefit by either of the deaths - but he did have considerable control over Mr Abernethieâ€™s affairs, and there could easily be some reason why Richard Abernethie should not live too long. But â€” you will say â€” if it is Mr Entwhistle who was worried, why should he come to me?And that I will answer â€” it is not the first time that a murderer has been too sure of himself.â€˜We now come to Mr Guthrie. If Mr Guthrie is really Mr Guthrie, the art critic, then that clears him. The same is true for the nun, if she is really a nun. The question is: are these people themselves, or are they somebody else?And there seems to be a strange â€” pattern â€” one might call it â€” of a nun all through this business. A nun comes to the door of Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house and Miss Gilchrist believes it is the same nun she has seen at Coraâ€™s house. Also a nun, or nuns, called here the day before Mr Abernethie died.â€˜Other features of the case caught my attention: the visit of an art critic, a smell of oil paint, a picture postcard of Polflexan harbour, and finally a bouquet of wax flowers.â€˜It was thinking about these things that led me to the truth. Richard Abernethie died suddenly â€” but there would have been no reason to suspect murder if it had not been for the words said by his sister Cora at his funeral. You all believed them because Cora Lansquenet had always been famous for speaking the truth at difficult moments.â€˜And now I come to the question that I suddenly asked myself: How well did you all know Cora Lansquenet? And Not well at all is the answer! There were actually only three people present that day who really knew Cora. Lanscombe, the butler, who is old and almost blind; Mrs Maude Abernethie who had only seen her a few times round about the date of her own wedding; and94
