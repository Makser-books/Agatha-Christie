After the Funeralbefore Richard Abernethie had died, but he learned nothing of value from her.He went now to get his overcoat and a couple of scarves, and went out into the garden and joined Helen Abernethie, who was cutting some flowers.â€˜Have you found out anything new?â€™ she asked.â€˜Nothing. But I did not expect to do so. Now tell me, Madame, of those at Mr Richard Abernethieâ€™s funeral, who knew Cora best?â€™â€˜Lanscombe. He remembers her from when she was a child. The housemaid, Janet, came after Cora had married and gone away.â€™â€˜And after Lanscombe?â€™Helen said thoughtfully, â€˜I suppose â€” I did.â€™â€˜Then why, on the day of the funeral, do you think she asked that question about Richard Abernethie being murdered? â€™Helen smiled. â€˜It was very typical of Cora! But I never knew whether she was just innocently asking such questions â€” or whether she wanted to shock people.â€™Poirot changed the subject. â€˜Mrs Maude Abernethie stayed the night after the funeral. Did she talk to you at all about what Cora had said? Did she take it seriously? â€™â€˜Oh no.â€™â€˜And you, Madame, did you take it seriously?â€™Helen Abernethie said thoughtfully, â€˜Yes, Monsieur Poirot,I think I did.â€™â€˜Because of your feeling that something was wrong? â€™ â€˜Perhaps.â€™He continued, â€˜There had been a separation, lasting many years, between Mrs Lansquenet and her family, and then, suddenly, Richard Abernethie went to see her. Why?â€™61
