Chapter 10Susan drove her car to the Kingâ€™s Armsâ€™ car park where she left it by a chauffeur-driven Daimler which was preparing to go out. Inside it was an elderly foreign gentleman with a large moustache.After supper, Susan questioned Miss Gilchrist about her uncleâ€™s visit to Cora.â€˜Did they get on well together?â€™â€˜Oh, yes. She did say that he had got very old â€” I think she said senile . . .â€™â€˜But you didnâ€™t think he was senile?â€™â€˜Well, not to look at. But I didnâ€™t talk to him much, I left them alone together.â€™Was Miss Gilchrist the kind of woman who listened at doors? She was honest, Susan felt sure, but. . .â€˜You didnâ€™t hear any of their conversation?â€™ Susan asked. â€˜Sometimes, in these small cottages, you canâ€™t avoid overhearing, and now that they are dead, itâ€™s really important to the family to know what was said at that meeting.â€™Miss Gilchrist nodded. â€˜I think they were talking about Mr Abernethieâ€™s health - and certain - well, ideas, he had. He blamed his ill-health on other people. A common thing, I believe, in the old. My aunt. . .â€™â€˜Yes,â€™ Susan interrupted, â€˜my uncleâ€™s servants were upset by his thinking ... It was the servants he suspected, I suppose? Of poisoning him, I mean?â€™â€˜I donâ€™t know. I - really donâ€™t know.â€™ But she looked away from Susan, so perhaps Miss Gilchrist knew more than she was willing to admit.42
