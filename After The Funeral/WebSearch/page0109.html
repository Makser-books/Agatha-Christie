Cultural notesWills and inheritanceA will is a legal document that describes how the money and property that someone leaves when they die is to be distributed to relatives and other people. It wasn't unusual for servants, like the old butler Lanscombe, to receive a sum of money to thank them for their loyal service. Wills were usually made in a solicitorâ€™s office but not always. To be legal, the signing of the will had to be witnessed, i.e. seen, by two people (usually not relatives) who knew the person writing the will. In addition to the two witnesses there had to be an executor. The executor was the person chosen by the person making the will to make sure that their wishes were carried out properly Quite often the solicitor would be named as the executor, but it wasnâ€™t unusual for a family member, like Timothy, Richard Abernethieâ€™s brother, to be named.TearoomsToday's coffee shop or cafe, selling Italian or American coffee and pastries, had not, at the time of the story (early 1950s), come to Britain. Tearooms, however, were very common everywhere. People would go to them to drink good quality tea and eat homemade cakes, sandwiches and scones. They were highly respectable places and the customers were usually middle and upper class women who had been out shopping. Before the war, a lot of the food people ate in Britain was sent in from other countries by ship. When the war started, this was no longer possible because the boats that usually brought the food were attacked and destroyed and the food did not arrive.The government had to make sure that there was enough food, not only for the people in Britain, but also for the soldiers fighting in the war. They did this by controlling how much food each person could buy every104
