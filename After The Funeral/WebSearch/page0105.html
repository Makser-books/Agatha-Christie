Agatha Christieâ€˜Yes, in two weeks.â€™â€˜Then let me wish you a happy journey.â€™She went with him to the door, and said, â€˜Monsieur Poirot, the income Richard left me meant more to me than theirs did to any of the others. You see â€” there is a child in Cyprus . . . After my husband died, my loneliness was unbelievable and when I was nursing in London at the end of the war, I met someone . . . We lived together for a little while, then he went back to Canada â€” to his wife and his children. He never knew about â€” our child. It seemed like a miracle to me â€” a middle-aged woman with everything seemingly behind her. Now, with Richardâ€™s money, I can send my â€œnephewâ€ to an even better school, and give him a start in life. I never told Richard. He was fond of me - but he would not have understood. I wanted you to know this about me.â€™Poirot bowed over her hand.? ? ?He got home to find someone sitting in the armchair on the left of the fireplace.â€˜Hello, Poirot,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Iâ€™ve just come back from the trial. They brought in a verdict of guilty, of course. But Miss Gilchrist is happy, you know. She spends most of her time making plans to run a chain of tearooms.â€™â€˜Some people might think that she was always a little mad,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜But me, I think not.â€™â€˜Goodness me, no, Poirot! She was as sane as you and I when she planned Coraâ€™s murder and carried it out in cold blood.â€™
