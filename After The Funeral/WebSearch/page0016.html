After the Funeralrain for some days, so there arenâ€™t any car tracks to go by - in case anyone came by car.â€˜There are strange things about the case, Mr Entwhistle. These, for instance.â€™ Inspector Morton pushed across his desk a collection of cheap jewellery. â€˜Those are the things that were taken. They were found just outside the house, hidden in a bush.â€˜Of course the companion, Miss Gilchrist, may have killed Miss Lansquenet, but I doubt it. Everyone says they were very friendly.â€™ He paused before continuing, â€˜According to you, nobody gains from Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s death.â€™â€˜I didnâ€™t say that,â€™ replied Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s income was an allowance made to her by her brother, her house is rented, and the furniture and jewellery would not be worth much to whoever sheâ€™s left it to. However, her legacy from her brother will be divided amongst the five other beneficiaries of Richard Abernethieâ€™s will, so all of them will benefit from her death.â€™The Inspector looked disappointed. â€˜Well, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a strong motive there for anyone to kill her - and especially not with a hatchet. Youâ€™ll be going to see Miss Gilchrist, I suppose? Sheâ€™s told us, I think, everything that she can, but you never know. Sometimes, in conversation, people remember things. Sheâ€™s a sensible woman - and sheâ€™s really been most helpful.â€™Strange, thought Mr Entwhistle, that Cora had been thinking about murder the very day before she herself was murdered.â€˜He was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™It was too ridiculous to mention to Inspector Morton. But what if Miss Gilchrist could tell him what Richard had said to Cora? I must see Miss Gilchrist immediately, said Mr Entwhistle to himself.II
