Agatha ChristieMaude Abernethie climbed the stairs painfully to her husbandâ€™s room.â€˜That was Helen. Enderby Hall is definitely sold. Helen suggests that we might like to go there for a visit before it goes. She was very upset about the way the smell of the paint is affecting your health. The servants are there still, so you could be looked after comfortably.â€™Timothy, who had been looking angry, now nodded his head approvingly. â€˜Itâ€™s thoughtful of Helen,â€™ he said. â€˜But moving might be too much for me.â€™â€˜Perhaps youâ€™d prefer a hotel, dear,â€™ said Maude. â€˜A good hotel is very expensive, but where your health is . . .â€™Timothy interrupted. â€˜Maude, we are not millionaires. Why go to a hotel when Helen has very kindly suggested that we could go to Enderby? Not that itâ€™s really for her to suggest! And I would like to see the old place again before I die. Yes, it is an excellent plan. The painters can finish while we are away and that Gillespie woman can stay here and look after the house.â€™ â€˜Sheâ€™s called Gilchrist,â€™ said Maude.Timothy waved a hand and said that it didnâ€™t matter what her name was.? ? ?â€˜I canâ€™t do it,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist. She was shaking. â€˜I simply canâ€™t stay here all alone. Iâ€™ve never been a nervous woman â€” but now Iâ€™d be terrified to be all alone here.â€™â€˜Of course,â€™ said Maude. â€˜Itâ€™s stupid of me â€” after what happened at Lytchett St Mary.â€™â€˜I suppose that itâ€™s . . . itâ€™s not logical, I know. But even that nun coming to the door startled me. Oh dear, I am in a. bad way . . .â€™66
