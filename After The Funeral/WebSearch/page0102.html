After the Funerallistened to a conversation between Richard and his sister. What he actually told her, no doubt, was the fact that he had not long to live, and that explains a phrase in the letter he wrote to her after getting home. The â€œnunâ€ was another of your suggestions. The nuns who called at the cottage on the day of the inquest suggested to you a mention of a nun who was â€œfollowing you roundâ€, and you used that when you were anxious to hear what Maude Abernethie was saying to her sister-in-law at Enderby. And also because you wished to go with her there and find out for yourself just what suspicions there were. To poison yourself, badly but not fatally, with arsenic, is a very old trick- and made Inspector Morton suspicious of you.â€™â€˜But the picture?â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜What was it?â€™Poirot slowly unfolded a telegram. â€˜This morning Mr Entwhistle went to Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house to look among the pictures in Miss Gilchristâ€™s room. He was to take the one of Polflexan Harbour to London and go to Mr Guthrie whom I had contacted by telegram. The hastily painted sketch of Polflexan was removed from the surface and the original picture was exposed.â€™He held up the telegram and read:â€˜Definitely a Vermeer. Guthrie.â€™Suddenly, Miss Gilchrist spoke. â€˜I knew it was a Vermeer. She didnâ€™t know! She was always talking about Enderby, and what they did there as children. You donâ€™t know how boring it is, listening to somebody saying the same things, hour after hour and day after day. Boring - boring - boring. And nothing to look forward to. And then - a Vermeer! Another Vermeer sold recently for over five thousand pounds!â€™â€˜You killed her for five thousand pounds?â€™ Susanâ€™s voice was shocked.97
