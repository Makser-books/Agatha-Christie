After the Funeralwhat she did, everyone protested immediately - that is right? And she then became confused and said something like â€œBut I thought â€” from what he told me . .The lawyer nodded. â€˜I wish I could remember more clearly. But Iâ€™m fairly sure she used the words â€œhe told meâ€ or â€œhe said . .And then everyone spoke of something else. You can remember, looking back, no special expression on anyoneâ€™s face?â€™ Poirot continued his questioning.â€˜No.â€™â€˜And the very next day, Cora is killed â€” and you ask yourself, â€œWas she killed because what she had said was true?â€ Me, I think, mon cher. exactly as you thought - that there is a case for investigation. You have spoken of these matters to the police?â€™â€˜No. I represent the family, Poirot. And if Richard Abernethie was murdered, there seems only one way it could have been done.â€™â€˜By poison?â€™â€˜Exactly. And the body has been cremated. There is now no evidence available. But I, myself, must be sure about it. That is why, Poirot, I have come to you.â€™â€˜Who was in the house at the time of his death?â€™â€˜Lanscombe - an old butler who has been with him for years, a cook and a housemaid. If he was murdered, one of them must be the killer.â€™â€˜Ah no! This Cora, she knows Richard Abernethie was killed, yet she agrees to keeping it quiet. Therefore it must be one of the family who is responsible. But we shall never be able to prove anything in the case of Richard Abernethie. However, the murder of Cora Lansquenet is different. Once we know â€œwhoâ€ then it should be possible to get the evidence we need. You have already done something? â€™ Poirot asked.27
