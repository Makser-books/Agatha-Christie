After the FuneralPoor Maude, thought Mr Entwhistle.? ? ?â€˜It is good of you to come, Entwhistle.â€™ Timothy raised himself up in his chair as he held out a hand. â€˜I mustnâ€™t do too much,â€™ he said. â€˜The doctorâ€™s forbidden it. Youâ€™ll have to do everything for me, Entwhistle. I canâ€™t go to the inquest or be bothered by business of any kind connected with Coraâ€™s estate. What happens to Coraâ€™s share of Richardâ€™s money?

I couldnâ€™t believe it when Maude came home and told me about Richardâ€™s will. I thought sheâ€™d made a mistake. She is the best woman in the world, Maude - but women donâ€™t understand money. I donâ€™t believe she even realises that if Richard hadnâ€™t died when he did, we might have had to leave our home here. That is a fact!â€™â€˜Surely if you had asked Richard . . .â€™Timothy gave a short laugh. â€˜I did say once to Richard that this place was getting a bit expensive to run and he said that we would be much better off in a smaller place altogether. It would be easier for Maude, he said! Oh no, I wouldnâ€™t have asked Richard for help. But I can tell you, Entwhistle, that the worry affected my health badly. Then Richard died and I felt so relieved about the future. But what hurt me was how Richard left his money. I assumed that he would leave everything to me. He came here - not long after Mortimerâ€™s death - because he wanted to talk about the family. We discussed young George - and Rosamund and Susan and their husbands. Both of those23
