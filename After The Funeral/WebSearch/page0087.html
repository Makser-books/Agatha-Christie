Agatha Christieto the house of Mr Timothy Abernethie. There is no one there but a woman by the name of Jones. You will say to Mrs Jones that you have been asked by Mr or Mrs Abernethie to fetch a particular object and take it to London.â€™And what is this object Iâ€™ve got to get hold of?â€™Poirot told him.â€˜But really, Poirot, I donâ€™t see â€”â€™â€˜It is not necessary for you to see. I am doing the seeing. You will take it to London, to an address in Elm Park Gardens.â€™Mr Entwhistle sighed, â€˜If we could only guess what Helen was going to tell me.â€™â€˜There is no need to guess, I know. I know what Helen Abernethie saw when she looked in her mirror.â€™? ? ?Breakfast had been an uncomfortable meal. Neither Rosamund nor Timothy had appeared, but the others were there.â€˜What I canâ€™t understand,â€™ said Susan, â€˜is what Helen was doing telephoning at that early hour, and who she was telephoning.â€™ â€˜She probably woke up feeling ill,â€™ said Maude, â€˜and came down to ring up the doctor. Then fainted and fell.â€™The door opened and Rosamund came in, frowning. â€˜I canâ€™t find those wax flowers,â€™ she said. â€˜The ones that were standing on the marble table on the day of Uncle Richardâ€™s funeral. Lanscombe, do you know where they are?â€™â€˜Mrs Helen had an accident with them, maâ€™am. She was going to find a new glass shade. They are in the cupboard behind the staircase, maâ€™am.â€™â€˜Come with me, Michael darling. Itâ€™s dark there, and Iâ€™m not going into any dark corners by myself after what happened to Aunt Helen.â€™82
