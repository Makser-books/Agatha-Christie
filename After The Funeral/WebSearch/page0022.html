After the Funeralâ€˜They never told me,â€™ said George Crossfield. â€˜I thought I should have a day off after the good news!â€™â€˜The good news?â€™Georgeâ€™s face went red.â€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t mean Uncle Richardâ€™s death. But knowing youâ€™ve inherited money certainly makes you feel lucky, so I went to the horse-races at Hurst Park. And I placed bets on two horses that won. I only made fifty pounds, but it all helps pay the bills.â€™ â€˜Oh yes,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜And there will now be additional money coming to you as a result of your Aunt Coraâ€™s death.â€™â€˜Poor old girl,â€™ George said. â€˜It does seem bad luck, doesnâ€™t it? I expect the police will question all the strange characters in the neighbourhood and make them prove where they were when the murder happened.â€™â€˜Not so easy if a little time has passed,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I was in a bookshop at half past three on that day. But would I remember that if I was questioned in ten daysâ€™ time? Would you remember which day you went to the races in â€” say â€” a monthâ€™s time?â€™â€˜Oh, I would remember because it was the day after the funeral.â€™â€˜True - true. And then you bet on two winning horses. You wouldnâ€™t forget that! Which were they, by the way?â€™â€˜Gaymarck and Frogg II. Yes, I wonâ€™t forget them in a hurry.â€™ Mr Entwhistle gave a small laugh and left.? ? ?â€˜Itâ€™s lovely to see you,â€™ said Rosamund, â€˜but itâ€™s very early in the morning.â€™â€˜Itâ€™s eleven oâ€™clock!â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.Michael Shane appeared, yawning.17
