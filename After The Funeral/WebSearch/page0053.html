Agatha ChristieThere was a box full of old photographs and drawing books. Susan put them to one side, sorted all the papers she had found, and began to go through them. About a quarter way through she came to a letter. She read it twice and was still staring at it, when a voice behind her made her give a cry of fear.And what have you got hold of there, Susan? Hello, whatâ€™s the matter?â€™â€˜George? How you frightened me!â€™Her cousin smiled at her. â€˜So it seems.â€™â€˜How did you get here?â€™â€˜Well, the front door was open, so I walked in. There was nobody about on the ground floor, so I came up here. If you mean how did I get to this part of the world, I decided this morning to come to the funeral, but the car broke down, then seemed to start working again. I was too late for the funeral by then, but I thought I might as well continue the journey because I rang your flat and Greg told me youâ€™d come to sort things out.I thought I might help you.â€™Susan said, â€˜Can you take days off whenever you like?â€™â€˜A funeral has always been an acceptable excuse for taking a day off. Anyway, I wonâ€™t be going to the office in future - not now that Iâ€™m rich. I will have better things to do.â€™ He paused and smiled, â€˜Same as Greg.â€™Susan had never seen much of this cousin of hers and had always found him rather difficult to understand. â€˜Why did you really come down here, George?â€™â€˜I came to do a little detective work to try and find out whether Aunt Cora really did know that someone had killed Uncle Richard. Now, whatâ€™s in that letter that you were reading so carefully when I came in? â€™48
