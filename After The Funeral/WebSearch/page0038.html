After the Funeralâ€˜No, no, I understand. Now after these visits, Mr Abernethie himself went away - first to his brother, and afterwards to Mrs Lansquenet. Can you remember anything he said about those visits on his return? â€™â€˜The Master used to talk quietly to himself sometimes â€” thinking aloud â€” when I was in the room. He said something about not understanding what had happened to the money their father had left Timothy. And then he said something like, â€œWomen can be fools in ninety-nine different ways but not in the hundredth.â€ And â€œYou can only say what you really think to someone of your own generation. They donâ€™t think youâ€™re imagining things as the younger ones do.â€ And later he said â€œItâ€™s not very pleasant to have to set traps for people, but I donâ€™t see what else I can do.â€™â€Richard Abernethie had spoken of setting a trap. For whom?? ? ?Mr Entwhistle decided he should take Helen into his confidence. â€˜I am going to ask you if you could stay here until the house is sold,â€™ he said, â€˜but there is another reason why I would be grateful if you would stay on. There is a friend of mine, a man called Hercule Poirot â€”â€™Helen said sharply, â€˜Hercule Poirot? â€™â€˜You know of him?â€™â€˜Yes.â€™ Her face was white. â€˜You think - that Cora was right? That Richard was â€” murdered?â€™Mr Entwhistle told her everything. When he had finished she said, â€˜Maude and I, that night after the funeral - it was in both our minds, Iâ€™m sure. And then - Cora was killed - and I told myself it was just coincidence â€” but oh! If I could only be sure.
