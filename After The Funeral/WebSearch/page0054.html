After the Funeralâ€˜Itâ€™s a letter that Uncle Richard wrote to Cora after heâ€™d been here to see her.â€™How very black Georgeâ€™s eyes were; and black eyes hid the thoughts that lay behind them.George said slowly, â€˜Anything interesting in it?â€™â€˜No, not exactly . . .â€™â€˜Can I see?â€™She hesitated for a moment, then put the letter into his hand. He read some of it aloud. â€˜Pleased to have seen you again after all these years . . . looking very well. . . had a good journey home and arrived back not too tired . . .â€™ His voice changed suddenly, â€˜Please donâ€™t say anything to anyone about what I told you. It may be a mistake. Your loving brother, Richard.â€™He looked up at Susan. â€˜What does that mean? â€™â€˜It might mean anything . . . â€™â€˜Oh yes, but it does suggest something. Does anyone know what he told Cora?â€™â€˜Miss Gilchrist might know,â€™ said Susan. â€˜I think she listened at the door to them. But sheâ€™s in hospital; sheâ€™s got arsenic poisoning.â€™ â€˜You donâ€™t mean it? â€™ George exclaimed.â€˜I do. Someone sent her some poisoned wedding cake.â€™ George whistled. â€˜It looks,â€™ he said, â€˜as though Uncle Richard was not mistaken when he talked about being poisoned himself.â€™? ? ?The following morning Inspector Morton called at the cottage. â€˜Arsenic was found in the small pieces of wedding cake that Dr Proctor took from here. Miss Gilchrist keeps saying that nobody would do such a thing. But somebody did. You donâ€™t know anything that might help us, Mrs Banks?â€™Susan shook her head.
