Old Lanscombe, the butler at Enderby Hall, shook his head. 
Soon they would be coming back from his Masterâ€™s funeral. Mr 
Richard Abernethie had been a good employer. He had died 
very suddenly, aged sixty-eight. Although he was ill, the family 
doctor thought that he would live for another two years. Ah, but 
the Master had never recovered from his sonâ€™s death, six months 
before. Mortimer Abernethieâ€™s death was a huge shock because 
he was such a strong and healthy young man.
Mr Richard was twenty-four when his father, Cornelius, 
died, and he had gone straight into the family business. He ran 
it successfully while keeping a very happy home in this huge 
Victorian house. He was like a father to his younger brothers 
and sisters. Now Leo, Laura, Geraldine, and Gordon were dead, 
only Timothy and Cora were left. It had been twenty-five years 
since Lanscombe had seen Cora, and he hadnâ€™t recognized her 
when she arrived before the funeral. She had grown so fat â€” and 
was dressed in a loose black dress with too many black necklaces! 
Well, Miss Cora had always been a bit â€” well, strange.
She had remembered him all right. Why, itâ€™s Lanscombe!â€™ she 
had said, and seemed so pleased to see him. Ah, they had all been 
fond of him in the old days.
Now cars were arriving, bringing the family home, and 
Lanscombe showed them all into the green sitting room.
A few minutes later, standing in front of the fireplace, Mr 
Entwhistle, the family lawyer, looked round. He did not know 
all the people there very well â€” some he had only met before 
the funeral and he needed to sort them out in his mind before 
he read the will. When he saw old Lanscombe handing round 
drinks, Mr Entwhistle thought, â€˜Poor old man - heâ€™s nearly

ninety, and half blind. Well, heâ€™ll have that nice little inheritance 
from Richard.â€™
Leo Abernethieâ€™s widow. Helen, he knew well. She was a 
very charming woman of fifty-one. It was strange that she had 
never married again after Leoâ€™s death, he thought.
Mr Entwhistle moved his attention on to George Crossfield, 
Laura Abernethieâ€™s son. Laura had left very little money when 
she died five years ago. George was a lawyer and a handsome 
young man - but there was a dishonest feel about him.
Now which of the two young women was which? Ah yes, 
that was Rosamund, Geraldineâ€™s daughter, looking at the wax 
flowers on the green marble table. She was a beautiful girl, 
but silly. She was an actress, not a very good one, and she had 
married an actor, Michael Shane, fair-haired and handsome. 
And he knows he is, thought Mr Entwhistle.
Susan, the late Gordon Abernethieâ€™s daughter, would be much 
better on the stage than Rosamund, Mr Entwhistle thought - 
she had far more personality. She also had dark hair and eyes 
that were almost golden in colour. Beside her was Gregory 
Banks, the man she had just married. He was a pharmacistâ€™s 
assistant! In Mr Entwhistleâ€™s world, girls did not marry men who 
worked in a shop. The young man, who had a pale face, seemed 
uncomfortable.
His eyes went on to Mrs Maude Abernethie. A big, sensible 
woman, she had always been a good wife to Timothy, who 
had been an invalid for many years. Mr Entwhistle suspected 
that Timothy only imagined that he was ill, that he was a 
hypochondriac, in fact.
Then Mr Entwhistle looked next at Cora Lansquenet. Her 
mother had died giving birth to her. Poor little Cora! She was 
an awkward girl, always saying the wrong thing. She met Pierre]]></text>

Lansquenet, who was half French, at art school. At the time, 
Coraâ€™s brother, Richard Abernethie, suspected that Lansquenet 
was looking for a rich wife, but Cora, who was not rich, ran 
away and married him anyway. They spent most of their married 
life in seaside towns that other painters seemed to live in, as well.
Lansquenet was a very bad painter, but Richard had generously 
given his young sister an income. Lansquenet had died twelve 
years ago, and now here was his widow, back in the home of 
her childhood, exclaiming with pleasure whenever she recalled 
some childish memory.]]></text>

â€˜As you know,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜I am the executor of Richard 
Abernethieâ€™s will . . .â€™
7 didnâ€™t know,â€™ interrupted Cora Lansquenet. â€˜Did he leave 
me anything?â€™
Ignoring her, Entwhistle continued, â€˜Originally, Richard 
Abernethieâ€™s will left almost everything to his son Mortimer. 
After Mortimerâ€™s death, Richard decided to get to know his 
nephew and nieces better before he made a new will.â€™
â€˜Did he leave me anything?â€™ repeated Cora.
Mr Entwhistle again ignored her, â€˜Apart from a legacy to 
Lanscombe, everything Richard owned is going to be divided 
into six equal parts. Four of these will go to: Richardâ€™s brother 
Timothy; his nephew George Crossfield; and his nieces Susan 
Banks and Rosamund Shane. The other two parts are going to 
be invested and the income from them will be paid to Mrs Helen 
Abernethie, the widow of his brother Leo; and to his sister, Mrs 
Cora Lansquenet. After their death the money is to be divided 
between the other four beneficiaries or their children.â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s very nice!â€™ said Cora Lansquenet. â€˜How much?â€™
â€˜About three to four thousand pounds a year.â€™
â€˜Good!â€™ said Cora. â€˜I shall go and visit Italy.â€™
Helen Abernethie said softly, â€˜How generous of Richard.â€™
â€˜He was very fond of you,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.
Helen said regretfully, â€˜I wish I had realised how ill he was.â€™ 
â€˜Nobody expected Richard to die as soon as he did. Even the 
doctor was surprised,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.
â€˜â€œSuddenly, at his residenceâ€ it said in the newspaper,â€™ said Cora.
â€˜I wondered then . . . Still, itâ€™s been kept quiet very nicely, hasnâ€™t 
it? I think youâ€™re all right. I mean - it should be kept in the family.â€™]]></text>

The faces that had turned towards her looked amazed.
Mr Entwhistle said, â€˜Really, Cora, Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t 
understand what you mean.â€™
Cora Lansquenet looked round in surprise. â€˜But he was 
murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™ she said.

     <text><![CDATA[Chapter 3
As he returned south to London by train, Mr Entwhistle thought 
about what Cora had said, and how everyone had reacted. 
Maude had exclaimed, â€˜Really, Cora!â€™
Somebody else had said, â€˜What do you mean?â€™
And at once Cora had said, â€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t mean - oh, but I 
did think from what he said - and his death was so sudden! Oh, 
please forget that I said anything at all â€” I know Iâ€™m always saying 
the wrong thing.â€™
And then there had been a discussion about Richard 
Abernethieâ€™s personal belongings. The house and its contents, 
Mr Entwhistle said, would be sold.
Coraâ€™s unfortunate comment had been forgotten. After all, 
Cora had always been, if not subnormal, embarrassingly naive. 
She had always said unwelcome truths.
Mr Entwhistleâ€™s thoughts stopped there. Yes, it was because 
Coraâ€™s comments were true, that they were so embarrassing!
When Mr Entwhistle had looked at Cora earlier, she had not 
looked like the girl he had known. But Coraâ€™s mannerisms were 
still there - such as the way she tilted her head to one side as she 
spoke. He remembered two phrases now.
â€˜But I did think from what he said . . .â€™ and â€˜His death was so 
sudden.â€™
Yes, Richardâ€™s death had been sudden. Richardâ€™s doctor had 
said only months ago that if Richard looked after himself, he 
might live two or three years. Perhaps longer.
Well, doctors could never be sure about how each patient 
would react to a disease. And Richard Abernethie had no great 
wish to live after his son Mortimerâ€™s death because there was no 
child or grandchild of his to inherit his fortune and his business.

     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
During the last six months, Richard, who had obviously been 
searching for an heir, had invited to stay with him, at different 
times, his nephew George, his niece Susan and her husband, and 
his niece Rosamund and her husband. Richard had also briefly 
visited his hypochondriac brother, Timothy.
The will that Richard had eventually made told Mr Entwhistle 
how disappointed he was with all of them.
Mr Entwhistle remembered what Cora had said earlier that 
day, â€˜I did think from what he said . . .â€™
He asked himself, What did Richard say? And when did he 
say it? Did Richard visit Cora Lansquenet or was it something 
he wrote in a letter to her which made her ask that shocking 
question:
â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™
? ? ?
Further along the train, Gregory Banks said to his wife, 
Susan, â€˜That aunt of yours must be completely mad!â€™
â€˜Aunt Cora? Oh, yes.â€™
George Crossfield said sharply. â€˜She really shouldnâ€™t say things 
like that. It might put ideas into peopleâ€™s heads.â€™
Rosamundâ€™s husband, Michael, said, â€˜I think George is right. 
Itâ€™s so easy to start people talking.â€™
â€˜Well, would it matter? It might be fun,â€™ said Rosamund. 
â€˜Fun?â€™ Four voices spoke at once.
â€˜Having a murder in the family,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜And if he 
was murdered, who do you think did it? His death has been very 
convenient for all of us. Michael and I are completely broke. 
Michael was offered a really good part in a play if he could afford 
to wait for it, but he couldnâ€™t. Now weâ€™ll have enough money for 
our own play if we want to.â€™

Nobody was listening. They were thinking about their own 
futures.
â€˜Now I can put my clientsâ€™ money back in their accounts 
before they notice itâ€™s missing,â€™ thought George.
Gregory thought, â€˜Now I can escape from this prison Iâ€™m in.â€™
Susanâ€™s hard, young eyes softened as she looked at her husband. 
She suspected that Greg loved her less than she loved him â€” but 
that only strengthened her feelings. Greg was hers; she would do 
anything for him. Anything.
? ? ?
Maude Abernethie, who was staying the night at Enderby, 
wondered if she should offer to stay longer to help Helen with the 
clearing of the house. But she really had to get back to Timothy 
to look after him. He had expected that most of Richardâ€™s 
fortune would come to him and he would be annoyed - and that 
was so bad for his health.
She sighed, then smiled. Things were going to be much 
easier now, financially. They could spend money on plants for 
the garden, for instance.
? ? ?
Helen Abernethie sat by the fire in the sitting room at 
Enderby Hall. How worried she had been lately about money. 
Now, thanks to Richard, all that was over.
Helen looked at the bouquet of wax flowers that stood on the 
green marble table. Cora had been sitting beside it when they 
had been waiting to go to the funeral. She had been so pleased 
at being back in her old home. Oh, but the way Cora had asked, 
â€˜But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™
The faces all round, shocked, staring at her!]]></text>
  </page>
  <page pageNumber = "14">
     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
And suddenly, seeing the picture of everyone clearly in her 
mind, Helen frowned. There was something wrong with that 
picture. Was it an expression on someoneâ€™s face? Was that it? 
Something that should not have been there ?
No, she didnâ€™t know what it was - but there had been 
something, somewhere, that was wrong.
? ? ?
Meanwhile, in the cafe at Swindon Railway Station, a 
lady in black was waiting for the connecting train to Lytchett 
St Mary, where she lived. She was eating cakes and looking 
forward to the future.
All those faces - when she had said that about murder! Well, 
it had been the right thing to say.
She smiled like a happy child. She was really going to enjoy 
herself at last.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Chapter 4
At a quarter to six the next evening Mr Entwhistleâ€™s telephone 
rang. The caller informed him that Mrs Cora Lansquenet had 
been murdered in her cottage in the village of Lytchett St 
Mary.
? ? ?
The next day a police Inspector named Morton came to see 
him and said, â€˜Itâ€™s not a very easy case. Mr Entwhistle. Letâ€™s 
imagine someone was watching Cora Lansquenetâ€™s house and 
saw her companion. Miss Gilchrist, come out of the house at 
about two oâ€™clock. This someone then deliberately takes the 
hatchet that was lying by the woodshed, smashes the kitchen 
window, gets into the house, goes upstairs, and attacks Mrs 
Lansquenet. She was hit six or eight times â€” it was a very violent 
crime. Then he opens a few cupboards, picks up a few pieces of 
cheap jewellery, and makes his escape.â€™
â€˜She was in bed?â€™
â€˜Yes. She returned late from the North the night before and 
woke with a terrible headache. She took some painkillers but felt 
no better by lunchtime. She decided to take two sleeping pills 
and sent Miss Gilchrist into town to change some library books. 
When this man broke in he could have taken what he wanted 
just by threatening her. Why did he need to kill her? It looks like 
she was sleeping peacefully when she was attacked.â€™
â€˜We do hear of pointless murders,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said.
Oh yes, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for any suspicious stranger 
who was seen in the neighbourhood: the local people all have 
alibis. Of course, her cottage is up a little road outside the village. 
Anyone could get there without being seen. There has been no

rain for some days, so there arenâ€™t any car tracks to go by - in 
case anyone came by car.
â€˜There are strange things about the case, Mr Entwhistle. 
These, for instance.â€™ Inspector Morton pushed across his desk 
a collection of cheap jewellery. â€˜Those are the things that were 
taken. They were found just outside the house, hidden in a bush.
â€˜Of course the companion, Miss Gilchrist, may have killed 
Miss Lansquenet, but I doubt it. Everyone says they were very 
friendly.â€™ He paused before continuing, â€˜According to you, 
nobody gains from Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s death.â€™
â€˜I didnâ€™t say that,â€™ replied Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s 
income was an allowance made to her by her brother, her house 
is rented, and the furniture and jewellery would not be worth 
much to whoever sheâ€™s left it to. However, her legacy from her 
brother will be divided amongst the five other beneficiaries of 
Richard Abernethieâ€™s will, so all of them will benefit from her 
death.â€™
The Inspector looked disappointed. â€˜Well, there doesnâ€™t 
seem to be a strong motive there for anyone to kill her - and 
especially not with a hatchet. Youâ€™ll be going to see Miss 
Gilchrist, I suppose? Sheâ€™s told us, I think, everything that she 
can, but you never know. Sometimes, in conversation, people 
remember things. Sheâ€™s a sensible woman - and sheâ€™s really been 
most helpful.â€™
Strange, thought Mr Entwhistle, that Cora had been thinking 
about murder the very day before she herself was murdered.
â€˜He was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™
It was too ridiculous to mention to Inspector Morton. But 
what if Miss Gilchrist could tell him what Richard had said to 
Cora? I must see Miss Gilchrist immediately, said Mr Entwhistle 
to himself.

? ? ?
Miss Gilchrist was a thin woman with short, grey hair. 
â€˜Iâ€™m so pleased you have come, Mr Entwhistle,â€™ she said. â€˜Iâ€™ve 
never, ever had any involvement with a murder. You read about 
them, of course, but I donâ€™t even really like doing that.â€™
Following her into the sitting room, Mr Entwhistle looked 
around him. There was a strong smell of oil paint and the 
cottage walls were covered with mostly very dark and dirty oil 
paintings. But there were watercolour paintings as well, and 
smaller pictures were in a pile on the window seat.
â€˜Mrs Lansquenet used to buy paintings at sales,â€™ Miss Gilchrist 
explained. â€˜She never paid more than a pound for any of them, 
and there was a wonderful chance, she always said, of finding 
something valuable.â€™
Entwhistle doubted if any of these were worth even the 
pound she had paid for them!
Of course, said Miss Gilchrist, noticing his expression, â€˜I 
don t know much myself, though my father was a painter â€” not a 
very successful one. But I used to do watercolours myself as a girl 
and it was nice for Mrs Lansquenet to have someone she could 
talk to about painting and who would understand.â€™
â€˜You were fond of her?â€™
Oh yesâ€™ said Miss Gilchrist. â€˜In some ways, Mrs Lansquenet 
was just like a child. She said anything that came into her head - 
but it surprised me sometimes how accurate she could be about 
things other than art.â€™
â€˜You were with Mrs Lansquenet for some years?â€™
Three and a half. I did most of the cooking â€” I enjoy cooking â€” 
and some light housework. None of the rough housework, of 
course. Mrs Panter came in for that. I could not possibly have
12]]></text>

been a servant. I used to have a little tearoom: The Willow Tree - 
it was a lovely place. All the cups and plates were blue and the 
cakes were really good. I was doing well and then the war came 
and food supplies were cut and I had to close the tearoom and 
had no money to pay the rent. And so I had to look round for 
something to do, but, I had never been trained for anything. 
I went to work for one lady as her companion, but she was so 
rude â€” and then I came to Mrs Lansquenet and we were friends 
from the start.â€™ Miss Gilchrist added sadly, â€˜How I loved my dear, 
dear little tearoom. Such nice people used to come to it!
â€˜But I must not talk about myself. The police have been very 
kind. Inspector Morton even arranged for me to spend the night 
with someone in the village, but I felt it was my duty to stay 
here with all Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s nice things in the house. The 
Inspector told me there would be a policeman on duty in the 
kitchen all night - because of the broken window - it was fixed 
this morning - though to be honest, I did pull the dressing table 
across the door . . .â€™
Mr Entwhistle said quickly, â€˜I know the main facts, but if it 
would not upset you too much to give me your own story of 
what happened . . .?â€™
â€˜Of course.â€™
â€˜Mrs Lansquenet got back from the funeral the night before 
last,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said. â€˜Did she talk about the funeral at all? â€™ 
â€˜Just a little. I gave her a cup of hot milk and she told me that 
the church had been full and that she was sorry she hadnâ€™t seen 
her other brother - Timothy. Well, then she said she would go 
to bed.â€™
â€˜She said nothing else that you can remember specially?â€™
â€˜She asked me if I would like to go to Italy. Italy! Of course I 
said it would be wonderful - and she said, â€œWeâ€™ll go!â€ She told

me that her brother had left her a very good income. Poor dear. 
Well, Iâ€™m glad she had the pleasure of planning.â€™ Miss Gilchrist 
sighed, â€˜I donâ€™t suppose I shall ever go to Italy now . . .â€™
â€˜And the next morning? â€™ Mr Entwhistle asked.
â€˜The next morning Mrs Lansquenet wasnâ€™t at all well. Sheâ€™d 
had almost no sleep at all, she told me, because of bad dreams. 
She had her breakfast in bed, and at lunchtime she told me that 
she still hadnâ€™t been able to sleep. â€œI keep thinking of things and 
wondering,â€ she said. And then she said that she would take some 
sleeping tablets and try and get a good sleep in the afternoon. She 
wanted me to go into town and change her library books. So I 
left just after two and that - and that - was the last time . . .â€™ Miss 
Gilchrist began to cry. â€˜She must have been asleep, you know, 
and the Inspector says that she didnâ€™t feel anything . . . And do 
tell her relations that apart from having such a bad night, she was 
really very happy and looking forward to the future.â€™
â€˜She did not speak at all about her brotherâ€™s death? The â€” er 
â€” cause of it?â€™
â€˜No. He had been ill for some time,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist, 
â€˜though I was surprised to hear it. He looked so very full of life.â€™ 
Mr Entwhistle said quickly, â€˜You saw him? When?â€™
â€˜About three weeks ago. It was a surprise. Mrs Lansquenet 
hadnâ€™t expected him. It upset her. She said something like â€œPoor 
Richard. He sounds senile. All these silly ideas that someone is 
poisoning him. Old people get like that.â€ And of course, that 
is only too true. When my aunt got old, she thought the servants 
were trying to poison herl â€™
not Mr Entwhistle was very worried. Richard Abernethie had 
 been senile. He asked whether Miss Gilchrist knew if Cora 
Lansquenet had left a will. She replied that Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s will 
was at the bank.

With that he left. He insisted on Miss Gilchrist accepting 
some money for her expenses and told her he would contact her 
again. In the meantime he would be grateful if she would stay on 
at the cottage while she looked for a new job.
Mr Entwhistle then left to talk to the bank manager and to 
have a further conversation with Inspector Morton.]]></text>

That evening, the phone rang and Mr Entwhistle heard Maude 
Abernethieâ€™s voice. â€˜Thank goodness youâ€™re there! This news 
about Cora has upset Timothy dreadfully - was it really murder? â€™ 
â€˜Yes,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.
It seems incredible,â€™ said Maude. â€˜And I am very worried 
about Timothy. Itâ€™s so bad for him, all this. He insists that you 
come up here to Yorkshire and see him. He wants to know if 
Cora left a will.â€™
â€˜There is a will. She left instructions for Timothy to be her 
executor but I will arrange everything. She left her own paintings 
and a piece of jewellery to her companion, Miss Gilchrist, and 
everything else to her niece, Susan.â€™
â€˜To Susan? But why Susan?â€™
â€˜Perhaps because she thought Susan had made a marriage that 
the family disapproved of. When all the bills are paid and the 
furniture is sold, I doubt Susan will get more than five hundred 
pounds. The inquest will be next Thursday. I will need Timothyâ€™s 
signature on certain documents as he is the executor, so I think it 
might be a good thing if I did come and see you.â€™
â€˜That is wonderful! Tomorrow? And youâ€™ll stay the night? 
The best train is the 11.20 from St Pancras.â€™
â€˜I will have to take an afternoon train, Iâ€™m afraid. I have other 
business in the morning.â€™
Mr Entwhistleâ€™s â€˜other businessâ€™ was visiting George, 
Rosamund and Susan.

â€˜They never told me,â€™ said George Crossfield. â€˜I thought I 
should have a day off after the good news!â€™
â€˜The good news?â€™
Georgeâ€™s face went red.
â€˜Oh, I didnâ€™t mean Uncle Richardâ€™s death. But knowing 
youâ€™ve inherited money certainly makes you feel lucky, so I went 
to the horse-races at Hurst Park. And I placed bets on two horses 
that won. I only made fifty pounds, but it all helps pay the bills.â€™ 
â€˜Oh yes,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜And there will now be 
additional money coming to you as a result of your Aunt Coraâ€™s 
death.â€™
â€˜Poor old girl,â€™ George said. â€˜It does seem bad luck, doesnâ€™t it? 
I expect the police will question all the strange characters in the 
neighbourhood and make them prove where they were when 
the murder happened.â€™
â€˜Not so easy if a little time has passed,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I was 
in a bookshop at half past three on that day. But would I remember 
that if I was questioned in ten daysâ€™ time? Would you remember 
which day you went to the races in â€” say â€” a monthâ€™s time?â€™
â€˜Oh, I would remember because it was the day after the 
funeral.â€™
â€˜True - true. And then you bet on two winning horses. You 
wouldnâ€™t forget that! Which were they, by the way?â€™
â€˜Gaymarck and Frogg II. Yes, I wonâ€™t forget them in a hurry.â€™ 
Mr Entwhistle gave a small laugh and left.
? ? ?
â€˜Itâ€™s lovely to see you,â€™ said Rosamund, â€˜but itâ€™s very early in 
the morning.â€™
â€˜Itâ€™s eleven oâ€™clock!â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.
Michael Shane appeared, yawning.

The lawyer did not approve of the young Shanesâ€™ way of 
living. He disliked the bottles and glasses that lay about the 
sitting room and the untidiness of it all.
But Rosamund and Michael were certainly a very handsome 
couple and they seemed very fond of each other.
Mr Entwhistle said, â€˜I have just come back from Lytchett St 
Mary.â€™
â€˜Then it was Aunt Cora who was murdered?â€™ Rosamund said. 
â€˜We saw it in the newspaper. And I said it must be. Two murders, 
one after another! â€™
â€˜Donâ€™t be silly, Rosamund,â€™ said Michael. â€˜Your Uncle 
Richard wasnâ€™t murdered.â€™
â€˜Well, Cora thought he was.â€™
Mr Entwhistle interrupted. â€˜You did come back to London 
after the funeral, didnâ€™t you? I ask because I phoned you the 
following day - several times in fact, and couldnâ€™t get an answer.â€™ 
â€˜Oh dear. We were here until about twelve, and then Michael 
went to lunch with someone. I had a lovely afternoon shopping â€” 
and then we had dinner at a Spanish restaurant. We got back 
here about ten oâ€™clock that night, I suppose.â€™
Michael was looking thoughtfully at Mr Entwhistle. â€˜What 
did you want to ask us, Sir?â€™
â€˜Oh! Just some things about Richard Abernethieâ€™s estate.â€™ 
Rosamund asked, â€˜Do we get the money now, or not for a 
long time?â€™
â€˜Iâ€™m afraid,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜that the law is full of delays.â€™ 
â€˜But we can get some money in advance, canâ€™t we?â€™ Rosamund 
looked worried. â€˜Itâ€™s very important. Because of the play.â€™
Michael said pleasantly, â€˜Oh, thereâ€™s no real hurry. Itâ€™s just a 
question of deciding whether to finance the play or not.â€™

â€˜It will be very easy to advance you some money,â€™ said Mr 
Entwhistle.
â€˜Then thatâ€™s all right.â€™ Rosamund gave a sigh of relief. â€˜Did 
Aunt Cora leave any money? â€™
â€˜A little. She left it to your cousin Susan.â€™
â€˜Why Susan? Is it much?â€™
â€˜A few hundred pounds and some furniture.â€™
â€˜Nice furniture?â€™
â€˜No,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.
Rosamund lost interest. â€˜Itâ€™s all very strange, isnâ€™t it?â€™ she 
said. â€˜There was Cora, after the funeral, suddenly saying, 
â€œHe was murdered! â€ and then, the very next day, she is murdered? 
I mean, it is strange, isnâ€™t it?â€™
Mr Entwhistle said quietly, â€˜Yes, it is very strange.â€™
? ? ?
Mr Entwhistle studied Susan Banks as she talked. In many 
ways she reminded him of her uncle, Richard Abernethie. She 
had the same energy he had. And yet Richard Abernethie had 
left her no more than the others. The reason must be because he 
didnâ€™t like her husband.
Mr Entwhistle looked at Gregory Banks, a thin, pale young 
man with reddish hair. He was quite pleasant, and yet there 
was something about him that made Mr Entwhistle uneasy. 
What had attracted Susan to him? It was obvious that her world 
revolved around her husband.
â€˜Have they any idea at all who the murderer might be?â€™ Susan 
asked.
â€˜They wouldnâ€™t tell me if they did - and the murder took 
place only the day before yesterday,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle.

â€˜Itâ€™s definitely got to be a certain kind of person,â€™ Susan was 
thoughtful. â€˜Someone violent, perhaps insane - I mean, to use 
a hatchet like that. But thinking of possible motives â€” did Cora 
leave her companion anything? â€™
â€˜A small piece of jewellery of no great value and some 
watercolours of fishing villages of sentimental value only.â€™
â€˜Well, no motive there - unless one is insane.â€™
Mr Entwhistle gave a little laugh. â€˜As far as I can see, the only 
person who had a motive is you, my dear Susan.â€™
â€˜Whatâ€™s that? â€™ An ugly light showed in Gregâ€™s eyes. â€˜How is 
Sue involved? What do you mean - saying things like that? â€™
â€˜Just my little joke,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle apologetically. â€˜Cora 
left her estate to you, Susan. But nobody can suggest than an 
estate of a few hundred pounds at the most is a motive for murder, 
for a young lady who has just inherited several hundred thousand 
pounds from her uncle.â€™
â€˜She left her estate to me?â€™ Susan sounded surprised. â€˜How 
extraordinary. She didnâ€™t even know me!â€™
â€˜I think she had heard rumours that there had been a little 
difficulty - er - over your marriage. There had been a certain 
amount of trouble over her own marriage - and I think she felt 
you were alike.â€™
â€˜She married an artist, didnâ€™t she? Was he a good artist?â€™
Mr Entwhistle shook his head.
Are there any of his paintings in the cottage?â€™
â€˜Yes.â€™
â€˜Then I shall judge for myself,â€™ said Susan. â€˜Is there anybody 
at the cottage now?â€™
â€˜I have arranged for Miss Gilchrist to stay there,â€™ Mr 
Entwhistle said. â€˜Your aunt made your Uncle Timothy her

executor, so I will tell him of your decision to go down to the 
cottage. And what are your plans for the future?â€™
â€˜Iâ€™ve got my eye on a building in Cardigan Street where I 
want to open a beauty salon. I suppose you can advance me some 
money? I may have to pay a deposit.â€™
â€˜I can arrange that,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I telephoned you the 
day after the funeral several times - but could get no answer. I 
thought perhaps you might like an advance. I wondered whether 
you might have gone out of town.â€™
â€˜Oh no,â€™ said Susan quickly. â€˜We were in all day.â€™
Greg said gently, â€˜You know Susan, I think our telephone 
wasnâ€™t working that day. I couldnâ€™t get through to someone I 
telephoned in the afternoon. I meant to report it, but it was all 
right the next morning.â€™
â€˜Telephones,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜can be very unreliable 
sometimes.â€™
Susan said suddenly, â€˜How did Aunt Cora know about our 
marriage?â€™
â€˜Richard may have told her. She changed her will about three 
weeks ago - just about the time he had been to see her.â€™
Susan looked surprised. â€˜Did Uncle Richard go to see her? Iâ€™d 
no idea! So that was when . . .â€™
â€˜When what? â€™
â€˜Nothing,â€™ said Susan.

â€˜Itâ€™s very good of you to come,â€™ said Maude Abernethie, as she 
led Mr Entwhistle to a very old car. â€˜Iâ€™m sorry about this old 
thing. In fact, it broke down when I was coming back after the 
funeral. I had to walk a couple of miles to the nearest garage and 
stay at a small hotel while they fixed it and that upset Timothy. 
I try to keep things from him as much as possible - but some 
things I canâ€™t do anything about - Coraâ€™s murder, for instance. I 
had to ask Dr Barton to give him something to calm him down. 
It seems so strange for someone to break in and murder her in 
the middle of the afternoon. If you broke into a house, surely 
youâ€™d do it at night - and there must have been times during the 
day when both Cora and her companion were out and the house 
was empty. It doesnâ€™t make sense to commit a murder unless itâ€™s 
absolutely necessary.â€™
Does murder ever make sense? It depended, Mr Entwhistle 
thought, on the mind of the murderer.
They arrived at a very large house which badly needed 
painting.
â€˜We have no servants,â€™ said Maude slightly angrily as she led 
the way in. â€˜Just a couple of women who come in every morning. 
If I have to go out in the afternoon, Timothy is completely alone.â€™ 
Maude led the way into the sitting room where she had 
already put tea things by the fireplace, and seating Mr Entwhistle 
there, disappeared. She returned in a few minutesâ€™ with a teapot 
and homemade cake.
Looking at Maude in the light of the fire, Mr Entwhistle 
suddenly felt sad. Maude Abernethie had not had any children 
but she was a woman built for motherhood. Her hypochondriac 
husband had become her child, to be guarded and watched over.

Poor Maude, thought Mr Entwhistle.
? ? ?
â€˜It is good of you to come, Entwhistle.â€™ Timothy raised himself 
up in his chair as he held out a hand. â€˜I mustnâ€™t do too much,â€™ 
he said. â€˜The doctorâ€™s forbidden it. Youâ€™ll have to do everything 
for me, Entwhistle. I canâ€™t go to the inquest or be bothered by 
business of any kind connected with Coraâ€™s estate. What happens 
to Coraâ€™s share of Richardâ€™s money? It comes to me, I suppose?â€™ 
Saying something about preparing dinner, Maude left the 
room.
â€˜The sum left invested for Cora,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜goes 
equally to you and George, Rosamund and Susan.â€™
â€˜But Iâ€™m her only surviving brother! I couldnâ€™t believe it 
when Maude came home and told me about Richardâ€™s will. I 
thought sheâ€™d made a mistake. She is the best woman in the 
world, Maude - but women donâ€™t understand money. I donâ€™t 
believe she even realises that if Richard hadnâ€™t died when he did, 
we might have had to leave our home here. That is a fact!â€™
â€˜Surely if you had asked Richard . . .â€™
Timothy gave a short laugh. â€˜I did say once to Richard that 
this place was getting a bit expensive to run and he said that 
we would be much better off in a smaller place altogether. It 
would be easier for Maude, he said! Oh no, I wouldnâ€™t have 
asked Richard for help. But I can tell you, Entwhistle, that the 
worry affected my health badly. Then Richard died and I felt so 
relieved about the future. But what hurt me was how Richard 
left his money. I assumed that he would leave everything to me. 
He came here - not long after Mortimerâ€™s death - because he 
wanted to talk about the family. We discussed young George 
- and Rosamund and Susan and their husbands. Both of those

girls have made bad marriages, if you ask me. Well, I thought 
Richard was asking for my advice because I would be head of the 
family after he died, and so I thought the control of the money 
would be mine.â€™
In his excitement Timothy had kicked aside the blanket that 
covered his legs and sat up straight in his chair. He looked, Mr 
Entwhistle thought, a perfectly healthy man.
â€˜Will you have a drink, Entwhistle?â€™
â€˜Not quite so soon. Maude has just given me an excellent tea.â€™ 
Timothy looked at him. â€˜Sheâ€™s a capable woman. Maude. She 
even fixes that old car of ours â€” sheâ€™s a good mechanic in her 
way, you know.â€™
â€˜Yes, I hear the car broke down coming back from the 
funeral. Timothy, I donâ€™t know how much Maude told you 
about the funeral and the relatives. Cora said that Richard had 
been murdered. Perhaps Maude told you.â€™
Timothy laughed. â€˜Thatâ€™s just the sort of thing Cora would 
say!â€™
Maude came into the room and said firmly, â€˜I think, Timothy 
dear, that Mr Entwhistle has been with you long enough. You 
really must rest. If you have arranged everything . . .â€™
â€˜Oh, weâ€™ve arranged things. Iâ€™ll leave it all to you, Entwhistle. 
Youâ€™ll see to Coraâ€™s funeral - wonâ€™t you? We shanâ€™t be able to 
come, but send an expensive wreath from us.â€™
Mr Entwhistle left for London by the breakfast train the 
following morning.
When he got home, he telephoned a friend of his.

â€˜I canâ€™t tell you how pleased I am that you were able to see me so 
soon,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said as Hercule Poirot led him to a chair by 
the fire. On one side of the room a table was laid for two.
Poirot said, â€˜You are welcome, mon ami. I returned from the 
country this morning. And you have something you wish to 
discuss with me?â€™
â€˜Yes. Itâ€™s a long story, Iâ€™m afraid.â€™
â€˜Then we will not have it until after we have eaten. Georges?â€™ 
Poirotâ€™s manservant, Georges, came in immediately with 
some pate de foie gras and hot toast.
â€˜We will have our pate by the fire,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜Afterwards 
we will move to the table . . .â€™
It was an hour and a half later that Mr Entwhistle sighed 
happily. â€˜You certainly know how to eat well, Poirot.â€™
â€˜At my age, the main pleasure, almost the only pleasure that 
still remains, is the pleasure of the table,â€™ the Belgian detective 
said.
A very good port was now by Mr Entwhistleâ€™s side. Poirot 
had a sweet liqueur.
â€˜I donâ€™t know,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle, â€˜whether Iâ€™m making a 
fool of myself. But Iâ€™m going to put the facts before you, and 
then Iâ€™d like to know what you think.â€™
He paused for a moment or two, then he started speaking 
again. He told the story clearly, which was appreciated by the 
little man with the egg-shaped head who sat listening to him.
When Entwhistle had finished there was a pause. Then 
Hercule Poirot said at last, â€˜It seems very clear. You have in your 
mind the suspicion that your friend, Richard Abernethie may 
have been murdered? A suspicion that you made on the basis of
25]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
one thing only â€” the words spoken by Cora Lansquenet at Richard 
Abernethieâ€™s funeral. The fact that she herself was murdered the 
day afterwards may be a coincidence. It is true that Richard 
Abernethie died suddenly, but he was being seen by a doctor 
who had no suspicions. Was Richard buried or cremated? â€™ 
â€˜Cremated â€” at his own request.â€™
â€˜So we come back to the essential point: what Cora Lansquenet 
said. And the real point is â€” that you believe she was speaking 
the truth.â€™
â€˜Yes, I do,â€™ replied Mr Entwhistle
â€˜Why? Is it because already you had an uneasiness about the 
way Richardâ€™s death happened?â€™
The lawyer shook his head. â€˜No, no, it isnâ€™t that.â€™
â€˜Then it is because of her â€” of Cora herself. You knew her 
well?â€™
â€˜I had not seen her for â€” oh â€” over thirty years.â€™
â€˜Would you have known her if you had met her in the street?â€™ 
Mr Entwhistle thought hard. â€˜I might have passed her by in 
the street without recognising her. But the moment I spoke to 
her face to face I would have recognised her. She wore her hair 
in the same way, and had a trick of looking up at you through 
her fringe, and she had a way of putting her head on one side and 
then suddenly saying something shocking. She had character, you 
see and character is always highly individual.â€™
â€˜She was, in fact, the same Cora you had known years ago. 
And she still said shocking things!â€™ said Poirot. â€˜The shocking 
things she had said in the past â€” were they usually correct?â€™
â€˜That was always the awkward thing about Cora. She spoke 
the truth when it would have been better not to.â€™
And Cora was quite sure Richard had been murdered. So she 
must have had some reason for the belief. Now tell me â€” when she said

     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
what she did, everyone protested immediately - that is right? 
And she then became confused and said something like â€œBut I 
thought â€” from what he told me . .
The lawyer nodded. â€˜I wish I could remember more clearly. 
But Iâ€™m fairly sure she used the words â€œhe told meâ€ or â€œhe 
said . .
And then everyone spoke of something else. You can 
remember, looking back, no special expression on anyoneâ€™s 
face?â€™ Poirot continued his questioning.
â€˜No.â€™
â€˜And the very next day, Cora is killed â€” and you ask yourself, 
â€œWas she killed because what she had said was true?â€ Me, I 
think, mon cher. exactly as you thought - that there is a case for 
investigation. You have spoken of these matters to the police?â€™
â€˜No. I represent the family, Poirot. And if Richard Abernethie 
was murdered, there seems only one way it could have been done.â€™
â€˜By poison?â€™
â€˜Exactly. And the body has been cremated. There is now no 
evidence available. But I, myself, must be sure about it. That is 
why, Poirot, I have come to you.â€™
â€˜Who was in the house at the time of his death?â€™
â€˜Lanscombe - an old butler who has been with him for years, 
a cook and a housemaid. If he was murdered, one of them must 
be the killer.â€™
â€˜Ah no! This Cora, she knows Richard Abernethie was 
killed, yet she agrees to keeping it quiet. Therefore it must be one 
of the family who is responsible. But we shall never be able to 
prove anything in the case of Richard Abernethie. However, the 
murder of Cora Lansquenet is different. Once we know â€œwhoâ€ 
then it should be possible to get the evidence we need. You have 
already done something? â€™ Poirot asked.

     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
â€˜I hoped that by a few casual questions I could clear certain 
members of the family from suspicion, perhaps all of them. In 
which case, Cora would have been wrong and her own death 
must have been done by a criminal who broke in. After all, it is 
simple. What were the members of the Abernethie family doing 
on the afternoon that Cora Lansquenet was killed? â€™
â€˜Eh bien.â€™ said Poirot, â€˜what were they doing? â€™
â€˜George Crossfield was at Hurst Park horse-races. Rosamund 
Shane was shopping in London. Her husband was at lunch 
discussing a play. Susan and Gregory Banks were at home all 
day. Timothy Abernethie was at his home in Yorkshire, and his 
wife was driving herself home from Enderby.â€™
Hercule Poirot nodded. â€˜Yes, that is what they say. And is it 
all true?â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t know, Poirot. George may have been at Hurst Park 
races, but I do not think he was. He said that he had bet on a 
couple of winners. I asked him the names and both horses he 
named had, I found, been expected to win â€” but only one had.â€™ 
â€˜Interesting. Had this George any urgent need for money at 
the time of his uncleâ€™s death?â€™
â€˜I have no evidence, but I suspect that he has been gambling 
with his clientsâ€™ money.â€™ He sighed. As for Rosamund, she is 
lovely, but not very intelligent. Her husband, Michael Shane, is 
a man with ambition. But I have no reason to suspect him of a 
violent crime. However, until I know that he really was doing 
what he says he was doing, I cannot take him off my list of 
suspects.â€™
â€˜You have no doubts about Rosamund, the wife?â€™
â€˜No â€” no â€” she is a delicate-looking creature.â€™
â€˜And beautiful!â€™ said Poirot with a smile. â€˜And the other 
niece?â€™]]></text>

  <page pageNumber = "34">
     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
â€˜Susan? She is a girl of huge ability, I think. She and her 
husband were at home together that day. I said that I had tried 
to telephone them on the afternoon in question â€” I hadnâ€™t, of 
course. Greg said very quickly that the telephone had not been 
working all day.â€™
â€˜So again there is no evidence . . . What is the husband like?â€™ 
â€˜He does not have a pleasing personality, though I cannot say 
exactly why. Susan has the mental strength and intelligence of 
Richard Abernethie. But I feel that she lacks the kindness and 
warmth of my old friend.â€™
â€˜Women are never kind,â€™ remarked Poirot. â€˜Though they can 
sometimes be gentle. Does she love her husband? â€™
â€˜She loves him almost too much, I would say.â€™
â€˜Me, I am not so sentimental about beautiful young ladies! 
Now tell me about your visit to the older members of the 
Abernethie family.â€™
Mr Entwhistle described his visit to Timothy and Maude and 
Poirot nodded.
â€˜So Mrs Maude Abernethie is a good car mechanic. And 
Mr Timothy Abernethie is not the sick man he likes to think 
himself. He also resented his brotherâ€™s success. What about the 
sixth beneficiary? â€™
â€˜Helen? I do not suspect her for a moment. Anyway, she was 
at Enderby. With three servants in the house.â€™
â€˜Eh bien, my friend,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜What do you want me to 
do?â€™
â€˜I want to know the truth, Poirot. I know you donâ€™t take 
cases any more, but I ask you to take this one. And I will be 
responsible for your fees. Come now, money is always useful.â€™ 
Poirot smiled. â€˜Not if it all goes in the taxes! But I will admit, 
your problem interests me! Because it is not easy . . . But I think

it will be best if you yourself talk to the doctor who was looking 
after Mr Richard Abernethie. He will speak more freely to you 
than to me. Ask him about Mr Abernethieâ€™s illness. Find out 
what medicines Mr Abernethie was taking at the time of his 
death and even before. Find out if he ever said anything to his 
doctor about being poisoned. By the way, this Miss Gilchrist 
is sure that he used the term poisoned in talking to his sister?â€™
Mr Entwhistle thought for a moment. â€˜It was the word she 
used - but she is the sort of witness who might change the actual 
words used, thinking that complete accuracy isnâ€™t important. I 
can talk to her again.â€™
â€˜Yes. Or I will do so.â€™ Poirot now said in a different voice, 
â€˜Has it occurred to you that your Miss Gilchrist may be in some 
danger herself? Cora spoke her suspicions on the day of the 
funeral. The question in the murdererâ€™s mind will be, did Cora 
tell them to anybody when she first heard of Richardâ€™s death? 
And the most likely person for her to have spoken to about them 
would be Miss Gilchrist. I think, mon cher, that she should not be 
alone in that cottage!â€™]]></text>

Dr Larraby, when questioned by Mr Entwhistle about the 
possibility of Richard Abernethie being poisoned, denied it at 
once. â€˜Entwhistle, who is making this suggestion?â€™
â€˜Abernethie never even suggested that one of his relations 
wanted him out of the way?â€™ Mr Entwhistle asked.
â€˜No!â€™
Mr Entwhistle told him of Coraâ€™s comment at the funeral and 
Dr Larraby smiled.
â€˜My dear fellow, the explanation for that is simple. The woman 
is at a certain time of life â€” searching for excitement, unbalanced, 
unreliable. She might say anything. They do, you know! â€™
â€˜You may be right,â€™ Mr Entwhistle said, standing up. 
â€˜Unfortunately we canâ€™t ask her as sheâ€™s been murdered herself.â€™ 
â€˜What?â€™
â€˜Youâ€™ve probably read about it in the paper. Mrs Lansquenet 
at Lytchett St Mary in Berkshire.â€™
â€˜I had no idea she was a relation of Richard Abernethieâ€™s!â€™ Dr 
Larraby was looking worried now.
? ? ?
Back at Enderby, Mr Entwhistle asked the old butler what his 
plans were.
â€˜Mrs Helen Abernethie has asked me to stay on until the house 
is sold, Sir.â€™ He sighed. â€˜I appreciate Mr Richardâ€™s generosity to me 
in his will, and though my married niece has asked me to go and 
live with them, well, it wonâ€™t be the same as living at Enderby.â€™
â€˜I know,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Itâ€™s a hard new world for us old 
men. I wish I had seen more of my old friend before he died. 
How did he seem those last few months?â€™

â€˜Well, he wasnâ€™t himself, Sir, not since Mr Mortimerâ€™s death.â€™ 
â€˜No. And he was a sick man - sick men have strange ideas 
sometimes. I imagine Mr Abernethie did, too. Did he speak of 
enemies sometimes, of somebody wishing to hurt him â€” perhaps? 
He might even have thought his food was being poisoned?â€™
Old Lanscombe looked surprised. â€˜I donâ€™t remember anything 
of that kind, Sir.â€™
â€˜He invited some of his family to stay with him, didnâ€™t he, 
before he died? His nephew and his two nieces and their husbands? 
Was he satisfied with those visits? Or was he disappointed? 
Lanscombeâ€™s eyes became cold. â€˜I really could not say, Sir.â€™
â€˜I think you could,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle gently. â€˜I liked your 
Master very much and so did you. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m asking you 
for your opinion as a man, not as a butler. Did you feel that 
something was â€” wrong? â€™
â€˜Only since the funeral, Sir. And I couldnâ€™t say exactly what 
it is.â€™
â€˜You know the contents of the will?â€™
â€˜Yes, Sir. Mrs Helen thought I would like to know. It seemed 
to me a very fair will.â€™
â€˜Yes, but it is not, I think, the will that Mr Abernethie 
originally intended to make after his son died.â€™
â€˜The Master, Sir, was very disappointed after Mr George had 
been here . . . Miss Susan he liked at once, but he didnâ€™t like her 
husband at all.â€™
â€˜And the other couple?â€™
â€˜I think the Master enjoyed having them here â€” but he never 
approved of acting as a job. He said to me one day, â€œItâ€™s a silly kind 
of life. It seems to me that actors and actresses live in a world of 
make-believe. Iâ€™m not sure it helps their judgment of what is right 
and what is wrong.â€ Of course he wasnâ€™t speaking directly.â€™

â€˜No, no, I understand. Now after these visits, Mr Abernethie 
himself went away - first to his brother, and afterwards to Mrs 
Lansquenet. Can you remember anything he said about those 
visits on his return? â€™
â€˜The Master used to talk quietly to himself sometimes â€” 
thinking aloud â€” when I was in the room. He said something 
about not understanding what had happened to the money 
their father had left Timothy. And then he said something like, 
â€œWomen can be fools in ninety-nine different ways but not in 
the hundredth.â€ And â€œYou can only say what you really think 
to someone of your own generation. They donâ€™t think youâ€™re 
imagining things as the younger ones do.â€ And later he said â€œItâ€™s 
not very pleasant to have to set traps for people, but I donâ€™t see 
what else I can do.â€™â€
Richard Abernethie had spoken of setting a trap. For 
whom?
? ? ?
Mr Entwhistle decided he should take Helen into his 
confidence. â€˜I am going to ask you if you could stay here until 
the house is sold,â€™ he said, â€˜but there is another reason why I 
would be grateful if you would stay on. There is a friend of mine, 
a man called Hercule Poirot â€”â€™
Helen said sharply, â€˜Hercule Poirot? â€™
â€˜You know of him?â€™
â€˜Yes.â€™ Her face was white. â€˜You think - that Cora was right? 
That Richard was â€” murdered?â€™
Mr Entwhistle told her everything. When he had finished she 
said, â€˜Maude and I, that night after the funeral - it was in both 
our minds, Iâ€™m sure. And then - Cora was killed - and I told 
myself it was just coincidence â€” but oh! If I could only be sure.]]></text>

Iâ€™ve been uneasy . . . Not just about what Cora said that day - 
something else. Something that I felt at the time to be wrong.â€™ 
â€˜Wrong? In what way? â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s just it. I donâ€™t know.â€™
â€˜You mean it was something about one of the people in the 
room?â€™
â€˜Yes - yes - something of that kind. But I canâ€™t remember 
what it was. The more I think . . .â€™
â€˜Donâ€™t think. That is the wrong way to try to remember 
something. Let it go. Sooner or later it will come into your 
mind. And when it does - let me know - at once.â€™
â€˜I will.â€™]]></text>

The front-door bell rang and for some reason Miss Gilchrist felt 
nervous. She went unwillingly to the door, telling herself not to 
be so silly.
A young woman dressed in black and carrying a small suitcase 
was standing on the step outside. She noticed the nervous look 
on Miss Gilchristâ€™s face and said quickly, â€˜Miss Gilchrist? I am 
Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s niece â€” Susan Banks.â€™
â€˜Oh dear, yes, of course. Do come in, Mrs Banks. I didnâ€™t 
know you were coming down for the inquest. I would have had 
something ready â€” coffee or tea.â€™
Susan Banks said quickly, â€˜I donâ€™t want anything. Iâ€™m so sorry 
if I frightened you.â€™
â€˜Well, Iâ€™m not usually nervous, but - perhaps itâ€™s just the 
inquest â€” I have been nervous all this morning. Half an hour ago 
the bell rang and I was almost too afraid to open the door â€” which 
was really very stupid as it is so unlikely that a murderer would 
come back - and it was only a nun, collecting for an orphanage. 
Did you come here by train? â€™
â€˜No, I came by car. I thought the road was too narrow to park 
outside so I drove the car on a little way past the cottage and 
found an old quarry and parked there.â€™
Susan Banks looked round the sitting room with interest. 
â€˜Poor Aunt Cora. She left what she had to me, you know.â€™
â€˜Yes, I know. I expect youâ€™ll need the furniture. Youâ€™re newly 
married, I understand.â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t want any of it,â€™ Susan said. â€˜I will sell it. Unless â€” 
is there any of it you would like? Iâ€™d be very happy . . .â€™ She 
stopped, a little embarrassed. But Miss Gilchrist gave a big smile. 
â€˜Now thatâ€™s very kind of you, Mrs Banks - but I put my own
35]]></text>

things in store in case - some day - I would need them. I had 
a small tearoom at one time, you know - then the war came 
. . . But I didnâ€™t sell everything, because I did hope to have 
my own little home again one day, so I put the best things in 
store with my fatherâ€™s pictures. But I would like very much, if 
you really wouldnâ€™t mind, to have that little painted tea table. 
Such a pretty thing and we always had tea on it.â€™
Susan, looking at what she thought was an ugly green 
table painted with large purple flowers, said that she would be 
delighted for Miss Gilchrist to have it.
â€˜Thank you very much, Mrs Banks. I imagine you would like 
to look through her things? After the inquest, perhaps?â€™ Miss 
Gilchrist asked.
â€˜I thought Iâ€™d stay here a couple of days and clear everything up.â€™ 
â€˜Sleep here, you mean?â€™
â€˜Yes. Is there any difficulty?â€™
â€˜Oh no, Iâ€™ll put fresh sheets on my bed, and I can sleep down 
here on the couch.â€™
â€˜But thereâ€™s Aunt Coraâ€™s room, isnâ€™t there? I can sleep in that.â€™ 
â€˜You - you wouldnâ€™t mind? â€™
â€˜You mean because she was murdered there? Oh no. Iâ€™m very 
practical, Miss Gilchrist. Itâ€™s been - I mean - itâ€™s been cleaned?â€™ 
â€˜Oh yes, Mrs Banks. All the blankets were sent away to the 
laundry and the whole room was cleaned thoroughly.â€™
She led the way upstairs. The room where Cora Lansquenet 
had died was clean and fresh and had no sinister atmosphere. 
Over the fireplace an oil painting showed a young woman about 
to enter her bath.
Susan gave a slight shudder as she looked at it and Miss 
Gilchrist said, â€˜That was painted by Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s husband. 
There are a lot more of his pictures in the dining room.â€™

â€˜How terrible! Where are Aunt Coraâ€™s own pictures?â€™
â€˜In my room. Would you like to see them?â€™
Miss Gilchrist proudly showed her the paintings.
Susan commented that it looked like Aunt Cora was very 
fond of villages by the sea and that perhaps her paintings, which 
were very detailed and very brightly coloured, might have been 
painted from picture postcards.
But Miss Gilchrist was indignant. Mrs Lansquenet always 
painted from nature!
â€˜Mrs Lansquenet was a real artist,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist sharply. 
She looked at her watch and Susan said quickly, â€˜Yes, we ought 
to leave for the inquest. Is it far? Shall I get the car?â€™
It was only five minutesâ€™ walk, Miss Gilchrist said, so they left 
together on foot. Mr Entwhistle, who had travelled by train, met 
them at the Village Hall.
At the inquest, the dead woman was identified. It was said 
that death was unlikely to have occurred later than four-thirty. 
Miss Gilchrist testified to finding the body. A police constable 
and Inspector Morton gave their evidence and the jury was quick 
to reach the verdict: Murder by some person or persons unknown.
Afterwards, when they came out again into the sunlight, 
half a dozen newspaper cameras clicked. Mr Entwhistle took 
them into the Kingâ€™s Arms pub for lunch in a private room. He 
said to Susan, â€˜I had no idea you were coming down today, 
Susan. We could have come together. Did your husband come 
with you?â€™
â€˜Greg had some important things to do. Weâ€™ve got great plans 
for the future - we are going to open a beauty salon, which I will 
run, and a laboratory where Greg can make face creams.â€™
Mr Entwhistleâ€™s mind went to other things. When Susan 
had spoken to him twice without his answering, he apologized.

â€˜Forgive me, my dear, I was thinking about your Uncle Timothy. 
I am a little worried.â€™
â€˜I wouldnâ€™t worry. Uncle Timothy is not ill at all - heâ€™s just a 
hypochondriac.â€™
â€˜It is not  his health that is worrying me. Itâ€™s Maudeâ€™s. 
Apparently she has fallen downstairs and broken her ankle. Sheâ€™s 
got to stay in bed and your uncle is terribly worried.â€™
â€˜Because heâ€™ll have to look after her instead of the other way 
around? It will do him a lot of good,â€™ said Susan.
â€˜Yes - yes, but will your poor aunt get any looking after?â€™ 
They came out of the Kingâ€™s Arms, rather warily but the 
newspaper reporters and photographers had gone.
Mr Entwhistle took them back to the cottage then returned 
to the Kingâ€™s Arms where he had booked a room. The funeral was 
to be on the following day.
â€˜My carâ€™s still in the quarry,â€™ said Susan when she and Miss 
Gilchrist had gone inside. â€˜Iâ€™ll go and get it and drive it along to 
the village later.â€™
Miss Gilchrist said anxiously, â€˜You will do that in daylight, 
wonâ€™t you?â€™
Susan laughed. â€˜You donâ€™t think the murderer is still nearby, 
do you?â€™
â€˜No â€” no, I suppose not.â€™ Miss Gilchrist looked embarrassed. 
But itâ€™s exactly what she does think, thought Susan.
Miss Gilchrist went towards the kitchen. â€˜Iâ€™m sure youâ€™d like 
tea, Mrs Banks!â€™
Susan went into the sitting room. She had only been there 
a few minutes when the doorbell rang. Susan went to the front 
door and opened it. An elderly gentleman said, smiling, â€˜My 
name is Alexander Guthrie. I was a very old friend of Cora 
Lansquenetâ€™s. May I ask who you are?â€™

â€˜I am Susan Abernethie â€” well, Banks now since I married. 
Cora was my aunt. Please come in.â€™
â€˜Thank you.â€™ Mr Guthrie followed Susan into the sitting room. 
â€˜This is a sad occasion,â€™ said Mr Guthrie. â€˜Yes, a very sad 
occasion. I felt the least I could do was to attend the inquest â€” 
and of course the funeral. I usually visited Cora once a year, and 
recently she had been buying pictures at local sales, and wanted 
me to look at some of them. I am an art critic, you know. Of 
course most of the paintings Cora bought were terrible; last year 
she wanted me to come and look at a Rembrandt she had bought. 
A Rembrandt! It wasnâ€™t even a good copy of one!â€™
â€˜Like that one over there, I expect,â€™ said Susan, pointing to 
the wall behind him.
Mr Guthrie got up and went over to study the picture. â€˜Poor 
dear Cora. Dirt,â€™ he said, â€˜is a wonderful thing, Mrs Banks! It 
gives a sort of romance to the most terrible paintings.â€™
â€˜There are some more pictures in the dining room,â€™ said 
Susan, â€˜but I think they are all her husbandâ€™s work.â€™
Mr Guthrie held up a hand. â€˜Do not make me look at those 
again. I always tried not to hurt Coraâ€™s feelings. A loving wife - a 
very loving wife. Well, dear Mrs Banks, I must not take up more 
of your time.â€™
â€˜Oh, do stay and have some tea. I think itâ€™s nearly ready.â€™ 
â€˜That is very kind of you.â€™ Mr Guthrie sat down again.
â€˜Iâ€™ll just go and see.â€™
In the kitchen, Miss Gilchrist was lifting a tray from the oven. 
â€˜Thereâ€™s a Mr Guthrie here,â€™ Susan said. â€˜Iâ€™ve asked him to 
stay for tea.â€™
â€˜Mr Guthrie? Oh, yes, he was a great friend of dear Mrs 
Lansquenetâ€™s. How lucky; Iâ€™ve made scones and thereâ€™s some 
homemade strawberry jam.â€™]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
Susan took in the tray and Miss Gilchrist, following with 
teapot and kettle, greeted Mr Guthrie.
â€˜Hot scones, how lovely,â€™ said Mr Guthrie.
Miss Gilchrist was delighted. The scones were excellent. The 
memory of the Willow Tree tearoom seemed to be in the room 
with them. Miss Gilchrist was clearly doing what she had been 
born to do.
â€˜I do feel rather guilty,â€™ said Mr Guthrie, â€˜enjoying my tea 
here, where poor Cora was so horribly murdered.â€™
Miss Gilchrist shook her head. â€˜No, no. Mrs Lansquenet 
would have wanted you to have a good tea.â€™
â€˜Perhaps you are right. The fact is that itâ€™s difficult for me 
to accept that someone I knew - actually knew - has been 
murdered! And certainly not by some casual thief who broke 
in and attacked her. I can imagine, you know, reasons why Cora 
might have been murdered -â€™
Susan said quickly, â€˜Can you? What reasons?â€™
â€˜Well, if she knew a secret, she would always want to talk 
about it. Even if she promised not to, she would still do it. She 
couldnâ€™t stop herself. So a little poison in a cup of tea - that would 
not have surprised me. And I would have thought she had very 
little to take that would be worth it for a burglar. Ah! Well, 
thereâ€™s a lot of crime about since the war. Times have changed.â€™ 
Thanking them for the tea, he said goodbye. Miss Gilchrist 
took him to the door and came back into the room with a small 
parcel in her hand. â€˜The postman must have been while we were 
at the inquest. He must have pushed this through the letterbox 
and it fell in the corner behind the door.â€™
Happily Miss Gilchrist tore off the paper. Inside was a small 
white box tied with silver ribbon. â€˜Itâ€™s wedding cake!â€™ She pulled 
off the ribbon. Inside was a slice of rich fruitcake with white

icing. â€˜How nice! Now who â€”â€™ She read the card attached. â€˜John 
and Mary. Now who can that be? How silly to put no surname. It 
might be my old friend Dorothyâ€™s daughter - but I havenâ€™t heard 
of an engagement or a marriage. Then thereâ€™s the Enfield girl â€” 
no, her name was Margaret. No address or anything. Oh well, I 
suppose Iâ€™ll remember soon . . .â€™]]></text>

Susan drove her car to the Kingâ€™s Armsâ€™ car park where she 
left it by a chauffeur-driven Daimler which was preparing to 
go out. Inside it was an elderly foreign gentleman with a large 
moustache.
After supper, Susan questioned Miss Gilchrist about her 
uncleâ€™s visit to Cora.
â€˜Did they get on well together?â€™
â€˜Oh, yes. She did say that he had got very old â€” I think she 
said senile . . .â€™
â€˜But you didnâ€™t think he was senile?â€™
â€˜Well, not to look at. But I didnâ€™t talk to him much, I left them 
alone together.â€™
Was Miss Gilchrist the kind of woman who listened at doors? 
She was honest, Susan felt sure, but. . .
â€˜You didnâ€™t hear any of their conversation?â€™ Susan asked. 
â€˜Sometimes, in these small cottages, you canâ€™t avoid overhearing, 
and now that they are dead, itâ€™s really important to the family to 
know what was said at that meeting.â€™
Miss Gilchrist nodded. â€˜I think they were talking about 
Mr Abernethieâ€™s health - and certain - well, ideas, he had. He 
blamed his ill-health on other people. A common thing, I believe, 
in the old. My aunt. . .â€™
â€˜Yes,â€™ Susan interrupted, â€˜my uncleâ€™s servants were upset by 
his thinking ... It was the servants he suspected, I suppose? Of 
poisoning him, I mean?â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t know. I - really donâ€™t know.â€™ But she looked away 
from Susan, so perhaps Miss Gilchrist knew more than she was 
willing to admit.

     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
Susan decided not to say any more on the subject until later 
and asked instead, â€˜What are your own plans for the future?â€™ 
â€˜Well, I told Mr Entwhistle I would be happy to stay on until 
everything here was cleared up and I wanted to ask you how 
long that was likely to be, because, of course, I must start looking 
about for another job as a companion.â€™
Susan thought for a moment. â€˜Thereâ€™s really not very much to 
be done here, but I wanted to tell you - that I hope youâ€™ll accept 
three monthsâ€™ salary.â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s very generous of you, Mrs Banks. I do appreciate it. 
And you would say that I had been with a relation of yours and 
that I had - proved satisfactory?â€™
â€˜Oh, of course.â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t know whether I ought to ask it.â€™ Miss Gilchristâ€™s hands 
began to shake and she tried to steady her voice. â€˜But would it 
be possible not to - to mention what happened here - or even 
the name?â€™
Susan stared. â€˜I donâ€™t understand.â€™
â€˜Because itâ€™s murder. A murder thatâ€™s been in the papers and 
that everybody has read about. People might think, â€œTwo women 
living together, and one of them is killed â€” perhaps the companion 
did it.â€ Itâ€™s been worrying me terribly, Mrs Banks, thinking that 
perhaps Iâ€™ll never get another job â€” not of this kind. And what 
else is there that I can do?â€™
Susan suddenly realized the desperation of this woman who 
was dependent on other peoplesâ€™ good opinion to get a job. It was 
true that Miss Gilchrist did not benefit from Cora Lansquenetâ€™s 
death - but who would know that?
Susan spoke with her usual confidence. â€˜Donâ€™t worry,â€™ she 
said, as Miss Gilchrist got up to take their coffee cups into the]]></text>

kitchen, â€˜Iâ€™m sure I can find you a job amongst my friends. There 
wonâ€™t be any difficulty.â€™
And just moments later an idea came to her. Of course, Susan 
said to herself. That would be perfect! And she went to the 
telephone . . .
Soon afterwards Susan went into the kitchen. â€˜Iâ€™ve just been 
talking to my Uncle Timothy. Would you like to go to Yorkshire 
and look after my aunt? She fell and broke her ankle, as you 
know. You could cook and look after Aunt Maude.â€™
Miss Gilchrist almost dropped the coffee pot in her excitement. 
â€˜Oh, thank you, thank you - that really is kind. I am really good 
at looking after sick people, and Iâ€™m sure I can manage your 
uncle and cook him nice little meals. Itâ€™s really very kind of you, 
Mrs Banks, and I do appreciate it.â€™]]></text>

Susan lay in bed, her mind racing. She had said she did not mind 
sleeping in this bed where Aunt Cora . . .
No, no she must not think about that. Think ahead â€” her future 
and Gregâ€™s. The building in Cardigan Street â€” it was just what they 
wanted. They could have the beauty salon on the ground floor and 
live in the lovely flat upstairs. And there was a room out at the back 
for a laboratory for Greg. And Greg would get calm and well again. 
There would be no more of those huge angers; of those times when 
he looked at her without seeming to know who she was. Once or 
twice sheâ€™d been really frightened. And it would have happened 
again if Uncle Richard hadnâ€™t died just when he did.
Uncle Richard had nothing to live for, so his death was a 
good thing, really. If only she could sleep. She always felt so safe 
in town â€” surrounded by people â€” never alone. Whereas here . . . 
Why did she feel that there was someone in this room, someone 
close beside her?
Surely that was a groan? Someone in pain â€” someone dying! I 
mustnâ€™t imagine things, I mustnâ€™t, I mustnâ€™t, Susan whispered to 
herself. There it was again . . . someone groaning in great pain. 
This was real! The groans came from the room next door.
Susan jumped out of bed and went into Miss Gilchristâ€™s room. 
She was sitting up in bed, her face twisted with pain. She tried 
to get out of bed but was very sick and then collapsed back on 
the pillows.
â€˜Please â€” ring the doctor. I â€” I must have eaten something . . .â€™
? ? ?
As soon as the doctor examined Miss Gilchrist, he sent for an 
ambulance.

     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
â€˜Sheâ€™s really bad then?â€™ asked Susan.
â€˜Yes. Iâ€™ve given her morphia to ease the pain. But it looks. . .â€™ 
He paused. â€˜What has she eaten?â€™
â€˜We had macaroni and cheese for dinner and a milk pudding 
and then coffee afterwards.â€™
â€˜Did you have the same things?â€™
â€˜Yes.â€™
â€˜And sheâ€™s eaten nothing else? No tinned fish? Or sausages?â€™ 
â€˜No.â€™
The ambulance came and took Miss Gilchrist away. The doctor 
went with her. When he had left, Susan went upstairs to bed. This 
time she fell asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.
? ? ?
A large number of people came to Cora Lansquenetâ€™s funeral. 
Most of the villagers were there and wreaths had been sent by 
the other members of the family. Mr Entwhistle asked where 
Miss Gilchrist was, and Susan explained. Mr Entwhistle was 
surprised. â€˜Wasnâ€™t that strange?â€™
â€˜Oh, sheâ€™s better this morning. They called from the hospital. 
People do get these stomach upsets.â€™
Mr Entwhistle said no more. He was returning to London 
immediately after the funeral.
Susan went back to the cottage and made herself an omelette. 
Then she went up to Coraâ€™s room and started to sort through the 
dead womanâ€™s things.
She was interrupted by the arrival of the doctor, who was 
looking worried.
â€˜Mrs Banks, will you tell me again exactly what Miss Gilchrist 
had to eat and drink yesterday. Everything. There must have 
been something she had and you didnâ€™t?â€™]]></text>

â€˜I donâ€™t think so . . . scones, jam, tea â€” and then supper. No, I 
canâ€™t remember anything. Was it food poisoning?â€™
â€˜It was arsenic.â€™ he said.
â€˜Arsenic? You mean somebody gave her arsenic?â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s what it looks like.â€™
â€˜Could the arsenic have got into her food or drink by accident? â€™ 
â€˜It seems very unlikely, although such things have been 
known. But if you and she ate the same things . . .â€™
Susan gave a sudden exclamation. â€˜Why, of course, the 
wedding cake! I didnâ€™t have any of that, though she offered me 
some.â€™ Susan explained about the cake that had arrived.
â€˜Strange. And you say she wasnâ€™t sure who sent it? Is there any 
of it left? Or is the box it came in still here somewhere?â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t know.â€™
They found the white box in the kitchen with a few very 
small pieces of cake still in it.
â€˜Iâ€™ll take this,â€™ the doctor said. â€˜Do you have any idea where 
the wrapping paper it came in might be?â€™ They looked but they 
did not find it.
â€˜You wonâ€™t be leaving here just yet, Mrs Banks?â€™ His voice 
was friendly, but it made Susan feel a little uncomfortable. â€˜No, 
I will be here for a few days.â€™
â€˜Good. You understand the police will probably want to ask 
some questions. You donâ€™t know of anyone who â€” well, might 
have wanted to hurt Miss Gilchrist? â€™
Susan shook her head. â€˜I donâ€™t really know much about her. 
She was with my aunt for some years â€” thatâ€™s all I know.â€™
â€˜Right. Well, I must go now.â€™
The cottage felt hot and uncomfortable and when he had 
gone Susan left the front door wide open and she went slowly 
upstairs to continue going through Aunt Coraâ€™s belongings.]]></text>

There was a box full of old photographs and drawing 
books. Susan put them to one side, sorted all the papers she 
had found, and began to go through them. About a quarter 
way through she came to a letter. She read it twice and was 
still staring at it, when a voice behind her made her give a cry 
of fear.
And what have you got hold of there, Susan? Hello, whatâ€™s 
the matter?â€™
â€˜George? How you frightened me!â€™
Her cousin smiled at her. â€˜So it seems.â€™
â€˜How did you get here?â€™
â€˜Well, the front door was open, so I walked in. There was 
nobody about on the ground floor, so I came up here. If you 
mean how did I get to this part of the world, I decided this 
morning to come to the funeral, but the car broke down, then 
seemed to start working again. I was too late for the funeral by 
then, but I thought I might as well continue the journey because 
I rang your flat and Greg told me youâ€™d come to sort things out.
I thought I might help you.â€™
Susan said, â€˜Can you take days off whenever you like?â€™
â€˜A funeral has always been an acceptable excuse for taking a 
day off. Anyway, I wonâ€™t be going to the office in future - not 
now that Iâ€™m rich. I will have better things to do.â€™ He paused and 
smiled, â€˜Same as Greg.â€™
Susan had never seen much of this cousin of hers and had 
always found him rather difficult to understand. â€˜Why did you 
really come down here, George?â€™
â€˜I came to do a little detective work to try and find out 
whether Aunt Cora really did know that someone had killed 
Uncle Richard. Now, whatâ€™s in that letter that you were reading 
so carefully when I came in? â€™

â€˜Itâ€™s a letter that Uncle Richard wrote to Cora after heâ€™d been 
here to see her.â€™
How very black Georgeâ€™s eyes were; and black eyes hid the 
thoughts that lay behind them.
George said slowly, â€˜Anything interesting in it?â€™
â€˜No, not exactly . . .â€™
â€˜Can I see?â€™
She hesitated for a moment, then put the letter into his hand. 
He read some of it aloud. â€˜Pleased to have seen you again after 
all these years . . . looking very well. . . had a good journey home and 
arrived back not too tired . . .â€™ His voice changed suddenly, â€˜Please 
donâ€™t say anything to anyone about what I told you. It may be a mistake. 
Your loving brother, Richard.â€™
He looked up at Susan. â€˜What does that mean? â€™
â€˜It might mean anything . . . â€™
â€˜Oh yes, but it does suggest something. Does anyone know 
what he told Cora?â€™
â€˜Miss Gilchrist might know,â€™ said Susan. â€˜I think she listened at 
the door to them. But sheâ€™s in hospital; sheâ€™s got arsenic poisoning.â€™ 
â€˜You donâ€™t mean it? â€™ George exclaimed.
â€˜I do. Someone sent her some poisoned wedding cake.â€™ 
George whistled. â€˜It looks,â€™ he said, â€˜as though Uncle Richard 
was not mistaken when he talked about being poisoned himself.â€™
? ? ?
The following morning Inspector Morton called at the 
cottage. â€˜Arsenic was found in the small pieces of wedding cake 
that Dr Proctor took from here. Miss Gilchrist keeps saying that 
nobody would do such a thing. But somebody did. You donâ€™t 
know anything that might help us, Mrs Banks?â€™
Susan shook her head.]]></text>

â€˜Well, young Andrews, the driver of the post van, doesnâ€™t 
remember delivering the parcel with the wedding cake in it. He 
canâ€™t be sure, though, so thereâ€™s a doubt about it.â€™
â€˜But - whatâ€™s the alternative?â€™
â€˜The alternative, Mrs Banks, is that an old piece of brown 
paper was used to wrap the parcel that already had Miss Gilchristâ€™s 
name and address on it and a used postage stamp. That package 
was then pushed through the letter box or put inside the door 
by hand to make her think that it had come by post. Itâ€™s a clever 
idea to choose wedding cake. Lonely middle-aged women are 
sentimental about wedding cake because they are so pleased to 
have been remembered by the young couple.â€™
â€˜Was there enough poison in it to - kill? â€™
â€˜That depends on whether Miss Gilchrist ate all of it. She 
thinks that she didnâ€™t, so Iâ€™d like to go upstairs if you donâ€™t mind, 
Mrs Banks.â€™
â€˜Of course.â€™ She followed him up to Miss Gilchristâ€™s room and 
said, â€˜Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s in a terrible state. I didnâ€™t have time to clean 
up before the funeral and then after Dr Proctor came I thought 
perhaps I ought to leave it as it was.â€™
â€˜That was very intelligent of you, Mrs Banks.â€™ He went to the 
bed and lifted the pillow. â€˜There you are,â€™ he said, smiling.
A piece of wedding cake lay on the sheet.
â€˜How extraordinary,â€™ said Susan.
â€˜Oh no, itâ€™s not. Perhaps your generation doesnâ€™t do it. But itâ€™s 
an old custom. They say that if you put a piece of wedding cake 
under your pillow, youâ€™ll dream of your future husband. Miss 
Gilchrist didnâ€™t want to tell us about it, I suspect, because she felt 
silly doing such a thing at her age. But I thought thatâ€™s what it 
might be.â€™ His face became serious. â€˜And if it hadnâ€™t been for an 
old maidâ€™s foolishness, Miss Gilchrist might not be alive today.â€™]]></text>

Two elderly men sat together in a room where everything was 
square. Almost the only exception was Hercule Poirot: whose 
stomach was pleasantly rounded, his head looked like an egg in 
shape, and his moustache curved upwards flamboyantly
He was looking thoughtfully at Mr Goby, who was small and 
thin. Mr Goby was famous for collecting information. Very few 
people knew about him and very few employed his services â€” 
but those few were usually extremely rich. They had to be, 
for Mr Goby was very expensive. His speciality was getting 
information â€” quickly. At a word from Mr Goby, hundreds of 
men and women, old and young, who worked for him, went 
out to question, investigate, and get results. Mr Goby had now 
almost retired from business. But he occasionally worked for a 
few old clients. Hercule Poirot was one of these.
Mr Goby was not looking at Hercule Poirot because Mr 
Goby never looked directly at anybody. Right now he seemed 
to be talking to the fireplace. â€˜Iâ€™ve got what information I could 
for you. Nowadays you can walk in almost anywhere with a 
notebook and pencil and ask people all about their lives and 
they wonâ€™t doubt for a minute that you are working for the 
Government â€” and that the Government really wants to know! 
Yes, Government snooping is a gift to investigators and long may 
it continue!
â€˜Now,â€™ said Mr Goby, and took out a little notebook and 
turned over the pages. â€˜Here we are. Mr George Crossfield. 
Heâ€™s been in debt for a while now. Heâ€™s been using money from 
his clientsâ€™ trust funds. For three months heâ€™s been worried and 
bad-tempered in the office. But since his uncleâ€™s death thatâ€™s all 
changed!]]></text>

â€˜What he said about being at Hurst Park races is almost 
certainly untrue. None of the people he usually places his bets 
with saw him. Nobody saw him in Lytchett St Mary either, 
but that doesnâ€™t mean he wasnâ€™t there. There are other ways to 
approach the cottage than through the village. He acted in plays 
at university, by the way. So if he went to the cottage that day, he 
could have used make up to change the way he looks. Iâ€™ll keep 
him in my book, shall I?â€™
â€˜You may keep him in,â€™ said Hercule Poirot.
Mr Goby turned another page. â€˜Mr Michael Shane. He likes 
money and is very attractive to women. Heâ€™s been having an 
affair with Sorrel Dainton, the actress, and his wife Rosamund 
doesnâ€™t know about it. She doesnâ€™t know much about anything, 
it seems. Sheâ€™s not a good actress, and is crazy about her husband.
â€˜On the day Mr Shane says he was meeting a Mr Rosenheim 
and a Mr Oscar Lewis for lunch to discuss a play, he sent them a 
telegram to say he couldnâ€™t come. What he did do was to go to 
the Emeraldo Car people and hire a car at about twelve oâ€™clock. 
He returned it at about six in the evening. The car had been 
driven just about the right number of miles, but it was not seen 
in Lytchett St Mary that day. However, there are lots of places he 
could have left it hidden a mile or so away; thereâ€™s even an old 
quarry a few hundred yards down the road from the cottage. Do 
we keep Mr Shane in? â€™
â€˜Most certainly.â€™
â€˜Now  Mrs Shane.â€™ Mr Goby told his left sleeve about 
Rosamund Shane. â€˜She says she was shopping. And she had 
heard she had inherited money the day before. She has accounts 
in a number of shops but she hasnâ€™t paid her bills, so itâ€™s possible 
that she went in here and there, trying on clothes, looking at 
jewellery, checking prices â€” and not buying anything! I asked

one of my young ladies, whoâ€™s knowledgeable about the theatre 
and the people in it, to follow her and stop by her table in a 
restaurant, She exclaimed the way they do, â€œDarling, I havenâ€™t 
seen you since Way Down Under. You were wonderful in that!â€ 
In a minute they were talking theatrical stuff and my girl then 
said, â€œI believe I saw you at so and so, on so and so,â€ giving the 
day. Most ladies are tricked by that and say, â€œOh no, I was . . .â€ 
whatever it may be. But Mrs Shane just looked blank and said, 
â€œOh, maybe. I couldnâ€™t possibly remember.â€ What can you do 
with a lady like that? â€™ Mr Goby shook his head sadly.
â€˜Nothing,â€™ said Hercule Poirot with some feeling. â€˜I shall 
never forget the killing of Lord Edgware. I was nearly defeated â€” 
yes, I, Hercule Poirot - by the extremely simple cleverness of 
an empty brain. Very simple-minded people often have the 
unexpected intelligence to commit a simple crime and then 
leave it alone. Let us hope that our murderer is intelligent and 
thoroughly pleased with himself and unable to resist showing 
off. But continue.â€™
Once more Mr Goby looked at his little book. â€˜Mr and 
Mrs Banks said they were at home all day. Well, Susan Banks 
wasnâ€™t. She went round to the garage, got out her car, and 
drove off in it at about one oâ€™clock. We do not know where 
she went and she came back at about five. I have no idea how 
many miles she did that day because she drives every day and, 
unlike Michael Shaneâ€™s hired car, no one keeps a note of the 
mileage.
â€˜As for Mr Gregory Banks, we donâ€™t know what he did. He 
didnâ€™t go to work and it seems he had already asked for a couple 
of days off because of the funeral. Since then heâ€™s left his job - 
where they do not like Mr Banks. He used to become very angry 
at even small things that upset him. Until about four months

ago â€” just before he met his wife and joined this particular 
chemistâ€™s shop - he was in a nursing home as a patient. He had 
made some mistake with a medicine he made for a customer 
at the pharmacy he worked at then. The woman recovered, 
and there was no prosecution. The shop didnâ€™t sack him, but 
he resigned and told the doctor he was filled with guilt â€” that 
he had done it deliberately. He said that the woman had been 
rude to him when she came into the shop, and so he had added 
an almost lethal dose of some drug or other to her medicine. 
â€œShe had to be punished for speaking to me like that!â€ was what 
he said. The doctors donâ€™t believe it was deliberate at all, he was 
just careless, but they say that he wanted to make it important 
and serious. Anyway, this nursing home cured him and sent him 
home, and he met Susan Abernethie. He got the job heâ€™s just left 
and another pharmacist at the same shop said he had a very bad 
temper.â€™
â€˜Mon ami,â€™ said Hercule Poirot. â€˜It really amazes me how 
you get your information! Medical and highly confidential most 
of it!â€™
Mr Goby said, looking at the door, that there were ways . . . 
â€˜Now we come to Mr and Mrs Timothy Abernethie. They 
are very short of money. Mr Abernethie enjoys being ill and 
the emphasis is on the enjoyment. He has everyone fetching 
and carrying things for him because he says heâ€™s too ill to do 
anything for himself, but he eats large meals, and seems strong 
physically. Thereâ€™s no one in the house after the daily cleaning 
woman leaves, and she says he was in a very bad temper on the 
morning of the day after the funeral. He was alone in the house 
and nobody saw him from 9.30 that morning until the following 
morning.â€™
â€˜And Mrs Maude Abernethie?â€™]]></text>

â€˜Everyone says she is a very nice lady. She left Enderby by 
car and arrived on foot at a small garage in a village on the 
way. She explained that her car had broken down a couple of 
miles away.
â€˜A mechanic drove her out to it and said they would have to 
get it in to the garage and it would be a long job. The lady went 
to a small hotel, arranged to stay the night, and asked for some 
sandwiches to take with her as she said she would like to go out 
walking and see something of the countryside. She didnâ€™t come 
back to the hotel till late that evening.â€™
â€˜And the times?â€™
â€˜She got the sandwiches at eleven. If she had walked to the 
main road, a mile away, she could have got a lift into a town 
called Wallcaster and caught an express train which stops near 
Lytchett St Mary. It could just have been done if the murder had 
happened fairly late in the afternoon.â€™
â€˜What exactly was wrong with the car?â€™
â€˜Do you want the exact details, Monsieur Poirot?â€™
â€˜No, no! I have no mechanical knowledge.â€™
â€˜It was a difficult thing to find. And also to fix. And it could have 
been done deliberately by someone who was familiar with the 
insides of a car.â€™
â€˜Wonderful! â€™ said Poirot. â€˜Can we clear nobody from suspicion? 
And Mrs Helen Abernethie?â€™
â€˜Sheâ€™s a very nice lady, too, and Mr Richard Abernethie was 
very fond of her. She came there to stay about two weeks before 
he died.â€™
â€˜Was that after he had been to Lytchett St Mary to see his 
sister?â€™
â€˜No, just before. Mrs Helenâ€™s income is less, since the war, 
than it used to be. She has a house in Cyprus and spends part of]]></text>

the year there. She also has a young nephew whose school fees 
she is paying.â€™
Poirot shut his eyes. â€˜And it was impossible for her to have left 
Enderby that day without the servants knowing? Say that is so, 
I beg you!â€™
Mr Goby looked down at Poirotâ€™s shoes. â€˜Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t say 
that, Monsieur Poirot. Mrs Abernethie went to London to get 
some extra clothes because she had agreed with Mr Entwhistle 
to stay on and see to things.â€™]]></text>

Inspector Morton came straight to the point. â€˜I had to come to 
London,â€™ he said. â€˜And I found your address, Monsieur Poirot. 
I was interested to see you at the inquest on Thursday and I 
came to ask if you could help us at all. Something must have 
brought you down there, Monsieur Poirot, and there have been 
developments.â€™ And he told him about the poisoned wedding 
cake.
Poirot took a deep, slow breath. â€˜I warned Mr Entwhistle 
to look after Miss Gilchrist. An attack on her was always a 
possibility. But I must admit that I did not expect poison.â€™
â€˜But why did you think she might be attacked?â€™
Poirot said, â€˜It begins, all this, at a funeral. Or rather, to be 
exact, after the funeral.â€™ And he told the story as Mr Entwhistle 
had told it to him. Then Poirot continued, â€˜This attempt to 
silence Miss Gilchrist, it is a mistake. For now there are two events 
which you need to investigate further.â€™
â€˜Yes. Well, if the postman did deliver the wedding cake, 
it seems odd that the parcel wasnâ€™t noticed until after this Mr 
Guthrie came. Weâ€™re checking up on him, of course. He could 
have placed that parcel where Miss Gilchrist found it. Now, Mr 
George Crossfield was in the area next day. What do you know 
about him, Monsieur Poirot? â€™
â€˜Not as much as I would like to.â€™
â€˜Itâ€™s like that, is it? There are quite a lot of people who are 
interested in the late Mr Abernethieâ€™s will, I understand. I hope 
it doesnâ€™t mean investigating all of them!â€™
â€˜I have a little information which you may not have. 
Naturally I have no authority to ask these people questions. In 
fact, it would not be wise for me to do so.â€™]]></text>

â€˜I will go slowly myself,â€™ said Morton. â€˜I donâ€™t want to warn

Poirot smiled. â€˜A very wise way of working. For myself, I go 
to Enderby Hall. It is people that I am interested in. I will pretend 
to buy, I believe, a big country house for foreign refugees. I will 
represent U.N.A.R.C.O.â€™
And whatâ€™s U.N.A.R.C.O.?â€™ asked Morton, puzzled.
â€˜The United Nations Aid for Refugee Centre Organization. 
It sounds appropriate, do you not think? And Enderby Hall 
might be just right. I will, of course tell Mrs Helen Abernethie 
the truth and ask for her help.â€™

Two days later, Hercule Poirot said to the Enderby Hall 
housemaid, â€˜Thank you. You have been most kind.â€™
Janet left the room. These foreigners, she thought! The 
questions they asked. It was all very well for Mrs Helen 
Abernethie to say that Monsieur Pontarlier was a doctor who 
wanted to buy the house and was also interested in unsuspected 
heart conditions such as the one Mr Abernethie must have had. 
But what business was it of his to nose around asking questions 
about the medicines the Master had taken, and where they were 
kept! And asking if any of the medicines he took were still in the 
house. Of course they had all been thrown away.
Poirot went downstairs in search of Lanscombe. It was quite 
clear to him that anybody could have got into the house on the 
day before Richard Abernethie died, and put poison into one of 
his medicines. Or someone could have put poison pills into the 
bottle next to his bed where his sleeping pills were. This was 
more likely.
The front door was kept locked at all times, but there was 
a side door that led to the garden which was not locked until 
the evening. At about quarter-past one, when the gardeners had 
gone to lunch and when the household was in the dining room 
or kitchen, Poirot had entered the grounds through the main 
gate, walked through the garden to the side door, and gone up 
the stairs to Richard Abernethieâ€™s bedroom without meeting 
anybody.
Yes, it could have been done. But the murder â€” if it was 
murder â€” of Richard Abernethie could never be proved. It was 
Cora Lansquenetâ€™s murder for which evidence was needed. What 
Poirot now wanted was to study the people who had been at the]]></text>

funeral by watching and talking to them, and then make his own 
conclusions about them.
â€˜Yes, Sir?â€™ Lanscombe said politely.
â€˜Mrs Abernethie tells me that you had hoped to live in the 
cottage by the gates when you retired?â€™
â€˜That is so, Sir. Naturally all that is changed now. When . . .â€™ 
Poirot interrupted, â€˜It might still be possible. The cottage is 
not needed for the U.N.A.R.C.O guests and the people who 
will look after them.â€™
â€˜Well, thank you, Sir. Most of the guests would be foreigners, 
wouldnâ€™t they?â€™
â€˜Yes. Amongst those who came from Europe to this country 
before and during the war are several who are old and unwell. 
The organization I work for has raised money to buy country 
homes for them. This place is, I think, very suitable.â€™
Lanscombe sighed. â€˜IfEnderby Hall has to be sold, Iâ€™m pleased 
to think that itâ€™s going to be the kind of place youâ€™re talking 
about. Weâ€™ve always welcomed the unfortunate in this country, 
Sir; it has always been something to be proud of.â€™
â€˜Thank you, Lanscombe,â€™ said Poirot gently. â€˜Your Masterâ€™s 
death must have been a great shock to you.â€™
â€˜It was, Sir. No one could have had a better Master.â€™
â€˜I have been talking with my friend and â€” er â€” colleague, 
Dr Larraby. We were wondering if your Master could have had 
an unpleasant interview on the day before he died? You do not 
remember if any visitors came to the house that day?â€™
â€˜Some nuns called, collecting money for sick children â€” and a 
young man came to the back door to sell some brushes. Nobody 
else.â€™

before Richard Abernethie had died, but he learned nothing of 
value from her.
He went now to get his overcoat and a couple of scarves, and 
went out into the garden and joined Helen Abernethie, who was 
cutting some flowers.
â€˜Have you found out anything new?â€™ she asked.
â€˜Nothing. But I did not expect to do so. Now tell me, 
Madame, of those at Mr Richard Abernethieâ€™s funeral, who 
knew Cora best?â€™
â€˜Lanscombe. He remembers her from when she was a child. 
The housemaid, Janet, came after Cora had married and gone 
away.â€™
â€˜And after Lanscombe?â€™
Helen said thoughtfully, â€˜I suppose â€” I did.â€™
â€˜Then why, on the day of the funeral, do you think she asked 
that question about Richard Abernethie being murdered? â€™
Helen smiled. â€˜It was very typical of Cora! But I never knew 
whether she was just innocently asking such questions â€” or 
whether she wanted to shock people.â€™
Poirot changed the subject. â€˜Mrs Maude Abernethie stayed 
the night after the funeral. Did she talk to you at all about what 
Cora had said? Did she take it seriously? â€™
â€˜Oh no.â€™
â€˜And you, Madame, did you take it seriously?â€™
Helen Abernethie said thoughtfully, â€˜Yes, Monsieur Poirot,
I think I did.â€™
â€˜Because of your feeling that something was wrong? â€™ 
â€˜Perhaps.â€™
He continued, â€˜There had been a separation, lasting many 
years, between Mrs Lansquenet and her family, and then, 
suddenly, Richard Abernethie went to see her. Why?â€™

â€˜I really donâ€™t know. He told me that he was going to see his 
brother Timothy, but he never mentioned Cora at all.â€™
As they went in by the side door, Poirot said, â€˜You are sure 
that during your visit, Richard said nothing to you about any 
member of the family which might be relevant? â€™
Helen said, â€˜You are speaking like a policeman.â€™
â€˜I was a policeman â€” once. And you want the truth, Mr 
Entwhistle tells me?â€™
Helen said with a sigh, â€˜Richard was disappointed in the 
younger generation. But there was nothing â€” nothing â€” that could 
possibly suggest a motive for murder.â€™
â€˜Ah,â€™ said Poirot.
In the sitting room Helen began to arrange the flowers in a 
bowl.
â€˜You arrange these beautifully, Madame. I think that anything 
you do, you would manage to do with perfection.â€™
â€˜Thank you, Monsieur. I think this would look good on that 
green marble table.â€™
There was a bouquet of wax flowers under a glass shade on 
the table. As she lifted it off, Poirot said, â€˜Did anyone tell Mr 
Abernethie that his niece Susanâ€™s husband had almost poisoned a 
customer when making up a medicine? Ah!â€™
The shade had slipped from Helenâ€™s fingers. It dropped on the 
floor and broke.
â€˜How careless of me. However, I can get a new glass shade. 
Iâ€™ll put the flowers and the broken shade in the cupboard behind 
the stairs.â€™
It was not until Poirot had helped her to carry the pieces to 
the cupboard that he said, â€˜It was my fault. I should not have 
shocked you.â€™
â€˜What was it that you asked me? I have forgotten.â€™

â€˜Oh, there is no need to repeat my question. Indeed â€” I have

Helen put her hand on his arm. â€˜Monsieur Poirot, is there 
anyone who doesnâ€™t have secrets that they would prefer stayed 
secret? Must these things be revealed when they have nothing to 
do with â€” with . . .â€™
â€˜With the death of Cora Lansquenet? Yes. Because one 
has to examine everything, and everyone has something to hide. I 
say to you, nothing can be ignored. I am not the police and 
what I learn does not interest me. But I have to know. I need, 
Madame, to meet everyone who was here on the day of the 
funeral. And it would be much easier if I could meet them here, 
and so I have a plan. The house, Mr Entwhistle will tell the 
family, is to be bought by U.N.A.R.C.O., and I will be here 
as that organizationâ€™s representative. I will call myself Monsieur 
Pontarlier and Mr Entwhistle will invite the family to come here 
and choose those things they would like before everything is 
sold. The young people will come easily. But the problem is that 
Mr Timothy Abernethie never leaves his home.â€™
Helen smiled. â€˜I believe you may be lucky there, Monsieur 
Poirot. I spoke to Maude yesterday. They have workmen in, 
painting the house and Timothy says the smell of the paint is 
making him ill. I think that they would be pleased to come here 
for a week or two. Maude is still not able to move around very 
well because she broke her ankle.â€™

At Maude and Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house, Miss Gilchrist had 
hurried out to the hall to answer the telephone, which was 
behind the staircase.
â€˜Itâ€™s Mrs Helen Abernethie speaking,â€™ she called up to 
Maude.
â€˜Tell her Iâ€™m just coming.â€™ Maude came down the stairs slowly 
because of her broken ankle.
Miss Gilchrist said quietly, â€˜Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™ve had to come 
down, Mrs Abernethie. Iâ€™ll just go up and get Mr Abernethieâ€™s 
coffee tray.â€™
Timothy looked at Miss Gilchrist angrily. As she picked up 
the tray he asked, â€˜Whoâ€™s that on the telephone?â€™
â€˜Mrs Helen Abernethie.â€™
â€˜Oh? I suppose theyâ€™ll talk for an hour! Pull that curtain aside, 
will you? And â€” Where are you going? â€™
â€˜Itâ€™s the front doorbell, Mr Abernethie.â€™
â€˜I didnâ€™t hear anything,â€™ Timothy said as Miss Gilchrist quickly 
left the room. Moments later she came up to Maude Abernethie, 
who was still on the telephone, to say, â€˜Iâ€™m so sorry to interrupt. 
Itâ€™s a nun. Collecting.â€™
Maude Abernethie said into the telephone, â€˜Just a moment, 
Helen,â€™ and to Miss Gilchrist, â€˜I only give money to our local 
church.â€™
Miss Gilchrist hurried away again.
Maude finished her conversation and came into the front hall. 
Miss Gilchrist was standing completely still by the sitting room 
door. She jumped when Maude spoke to her.
â€˜Thereâ€™s nothing the matter, is there, Miss Gilchrist? â€™
â€˜Oh no, Mrs Abernethie, I was thinking about something . . .â€™

Maude Abernethie climbed the stairs painfully to her

â€˜That was Helen. Enderby Hall is definitely sold. Helen 
suggests that we might like to go there for a visit before it 
goes. She was very upset about the way the smell of the paint is 
affecting your health. The servants are there still, so you could 
be looked after comfortably.â€™
Timothy, who had been looking angry, now nodded his head 
approvingly. â€˜Itâ€™s thoughtful of Helen,â€™ he said. â€˜But moving 
might be too much for me.â€™
â€˜Perhaps youâ€™d prefer a hotel, dear,â€™ said Maude. â€˜A good hotel 
is very expensive, but where your health is . . .â€™
Timothy interrupted. â€˜Maude, we are not millionaires. Why go 
to a hotel when Helen has very kindly suggested that we could 
go to Enderby? Not that itâ€™s really for her to suggest! And I 
would like to see the old place again before I die. Yes, it is an 
excellent plan. The painters can finish while we are away and 
that Gillespie woman can stay here and look after the house.â€™ 
â€˜Sheâ€™s called Gilchrist,â€™ said Maude.
Timothy waved a hand and said that it didnâ€™t matter what her 
name was.
? ? ?
â€˜I canâ€™t do it,â€™ said Miss Gilchrist. She was shaking. â€˜I simply 
canâ€™t stay here all alone. Iâ€™ve never been a nervous woman â€” but 
now Iâ€™d be terrified to be all alone here.â€™
â€˜Of course,â€™ said Maude. â€˜Itâ€™s stupid of me â€” after what 
happened at Lytchett St Mary.â€™
â€˜I suppose that itâ€™s . . . itâ€™s not logical, I know. But even 
that nun coming to the door startled me. Oh dear, I am in a. bad 
way . . .â€™

Hercule Poirot drank his after-dinner coffee slowly and between 
half-closed eyes looked at the other people in the room. He had 
wanted them there â€” all together, and he had got them. Mr 
Entwhistle had described all these people well but Poirot had 
wanted to see for himself, then he would have a very good idea â€” 
not of how and when â€” but of who would be prepared to kill.
But it was not going to be easy. He could see almost all of 
these people as a possible â€” though not a likely â€” murderer.
George Crossfield might kill - as a hunted animal might kill 
to defend itself.
Susan Banks could do it calmly â€” efficiently â€” to further a 
plan.
Gregory Banks could, because he had something in him 
which wanted punishment.
Michael Shane was possible because he was ambitious and had 
a murdererâ€™s vanity.
Rosamund Shane could, because she saw everything in the 
most simple way.
Timothy Abernethie could do it because he really wanted the 
power his brotherâ€™s money would give him.
Maude Abernethie might be able because Timothy had 
become her child and where her child was concerned, she would 
be ruthless.
Even Miss Gilchrist, he thought, might have thought about 
murdering someone if it could have given her back the Willow 
Tree tearoom!
And Helen Abernethie? She was too civilized â€” too lacking 
in violence. And she had loved Richard Abernethie as a 
brother.

Poirot sighed. There would have to be more conversation. 
Much more conversation. For in conversation, either through 
a lie or through truth, people always gave themselves away.
He had been introduced by Helen to the group as Monsieur 
Pontarlier, a doctor, the representative of U.N.A.R.C.O. He had 
watched and listened â€” openly and behind doors! He had talked 
with all of them, had spent a long half-hour listening to Timothy 
talking about his health and the terrible effects of paint on it. 
Paint? Poirot frowned. Somebody else had said something about 
paint â€” Mr Entwhistle?
There had also been a discussion of a different kind of 
painting. Pierre Lansquenet as a painter; of Cora Lansquenetâ€™s 
paintings, praised by Miss Gilchrist, laughed at by Susan.
â€˜Just like picture postcards,â€™ she had said. â€˜She painted them 
from postcards, too.â€™
Miss Gilchrist had been upset and had said that dear Mrs 
Lansquenet always painted from nature.
â€˜But she didnâ€™t,â€™ said Susan to Poirot when Miss Gilchrist had 
gone out of the room.
â€˜And how do you know?â€™
Poirot watched the confident way Susan replied.
She will always be sure, this one, he thought. And perhaps 
sometimes, she will be too sure . . .
Susan continued, â€˜One picture is of a village called 
Polflexan, showing the lighthouse and the pier. But the pier 
was destroyed in the war, and since Aunt Coraâ€™s sketch was 
only done two years ago, it canâ€™t really be from nature, can it? 
But the postcards they sell there still show the pier as it used to 
be. There was one in her bedroom. Itâ€™s funny, isnâ€™t it, the way 
people get found out?â€™
â€˜Yes, it is, as you say, funny.â€™

â€˜I suppose youâ€™ll have to cut Enderby up and have lots of 
horrible small rooms.â€™
â€˜In the bedrooms, yes. But most of the ground floor rooms we 
shall not touch. Does it sadden you, Madame, that this old family 
mansion of yours should go this way â€” to strangers?â€™
â€˜Of course not.â€™ Susan looked amused. â€˜Iâ€™ve always thought 
the house was ugly on the outside - and almost unacceptably 
luxurious inside.â€™
â€˜But I understand that you yourself are planning such a place? 
Everything luxurious and the best that money can buy.â€™
Susan laughed. â€˜Itâ€™s just a place of business. Women think a 
great deal about their appearance â€” and thatâ€™s where I come in.â€™ 
â€˜Tell me.â€™
And she told him about her plans for a beauty salon. He 
appreciated her business sense, her boldness of planning and her 
attention to detail. Perhaps a little ruthless . . . Watching her, he 
had said, â€˜Yes, you will succeed. How fortunate that you have 
the money. To have had these creative ideas and to have had no 
money . . . â€™
â€˜I would have raised the money somehow â€” got someone to 
invest in me!â€™
â€˜Ah! Of course. Even if he had not died, your uncle would 
have invested in you.â€™
â€˜Oh no, he wouldnâ€™t. Uncle Richard made me very angry. 
The old shouldnâ€™t stand in the way of the young. I â€” oh, I beg 
your pardon.â€™
Hercule Poirot laughed easily and stroked his moustache. â€˜I 
am old, yes. But I do not stand in the way of young people. And 
here is your husband come to join our little discussion . . . We 
talk, Mr Banks, of opportunity â€” opportunity that must be taken 
with both hands. Let us hear your views.â€™]]></text>

But Gregory Banks said nothing!
Poirot had talked with Maude Abernethie, who said how 
fortunate it had been that Timothy was able to come to 
Enderby, and how kind it had been of Helen to invite Miss 
Gilchrist also.
â€˜For she is most useful,â€™ Maude said. â€˜It was really fortunate 
that she was too scared to stay alone in our house, though I admit 
I was annoyed at the time.â€™
â€˜Too scared?â€™
Poirot listened whilst Maude explained.
â€˜She was frightened, you say? And yet could not exactly say 
why? Had anything particular happened that day? â€™ he asked.
â€˜Oh, I donâ€™t think so. It seems to have started when she left 
Lytchett St Mary, or so she said. She didnâ€™t seem to mind being 
alone when she was there.â€™
And the result, Poirot thought, had been a piece of poisoned 
wedding cake. Not very surprising that Miss Gilchrist was 
frightened after that. . . But something in Timothy Abernethieâ€™s 
house had made Miss Gilchrist afraid. What?
Finding himself alone with Miss Gilchrist for a few minutes 
before dinner, Poirot had raised the subject. â€˜It would be 
impossible for me to mention the matter of murder to members 
of the family. But I am fascinated. It was such a violent crime - 
to attack a sensitive artist in a lonely cottage. Terrible for her 
family. But terrible, also, for you. Since Mrs Maude Abernethie 
says that you were there at the time?â€™
â€˜Yes, I was. And if youâ€™ll excuse me, Monsieur Pontarlier, I 
donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€™
â€˜I understand completely.â€™
Poirot waited. And, as he had thought, Miss Gilchrist 
immediately began to talk about it.]]></text>

â€˜You were wise, I think, not to stay in that cottage alone,â€™ 
he said when she had finished. â€˜I understand that you were even 
afraid to be alone in the house of Mr Timothy Abernethie whilst 
they came here?â€™
â€˜Iâ€™m ashamed about that. It was just a kind of panic I had â€” I 
really donâ€™t know why.â€™
â€˜But you had just recovered from a terrible attempt to poison 
you â€” and you are still frightened, are you not?â€™
â€˜Oh, not since I came here. There are so many people and 
such a nice family atmosphere. Oh, no, everything seems all 
right here.â€™
â€˜It seems to me that there must have been something that 
happened at Stansfield Grange, Timothy and Maudeâ€™s house, that 
made you so afraid. I think some small happening might have 
made your subconscious fears reach a high point. Now what, do 
you think, was this happening?â€™
Miss Gilchrist thought for a moment, and then said, 
unexpectedly, â€˜I think, you know, Monsieur Pontarlier, it was 
the nun.â€™
Before Poirot could question this, Susan and her husband 
came in, closely followed by Helen.
â€˜A nun,â€™ thought Poirot . . . â€˜Now where have I heard 
something about a nun? â€™
He decided to lead the conversation on to nuns during the 
evening.]]></text>

The familyâ€™s general opinion was that Helen should have 
avoided having Monsieur Pontarlier at Enderby Hall during this 
particular weekend, but fortunately this strange little foreigner 
did not seem to know much English.
After twenty-four hours of walking round and examining 
the contents of the house, the heirs of Richard Abernethie were 
ready to say what they wanted.
â€˜I donâ€™t suppose I have long to live,â€™ said Timothy in a weak 
voice. And because I loved it as a child, I would like to have the 
Spode china dinner service.â€™
â€˜Youâ€™re too late, Uncle,â€™ George said. â€˜I asked Helen for the 
Spode this morning.â€™
Timothy became purple in the face. â€˜Now look here, Iâ€™m 
Richardâ€™s only surviving brother. That service is mine.â€™
â€˜No Uncle, the Spodeâ€™s mine. First come, first served.â€™ 
â€˜Nonsense! â€™ Timothy placed a hand to his heart, and groaned, 
â€˜This is very bad for me. If I could have â€” a little brandy.â€™
Miss Gilchrist hurried to get it. â€˜Here you are, Mr Abernethie. 
Please â€” please donâ€™t excite yourself. Are you sure you shouldnâ€™t 
go up to bed?â€™
â€˜Donâ€™t be a fool.â€™ Timothy drank the brandy. â€˜Iâ€™m not leaving 
this room until this is settled.â€™
â€˜Really, George,â€™ said Maude. â€˜If Timothy wants the Spode 
service, he will have it!â€™
â€˜Itâ€™s ugly anyway,â€™ said Susan.
â€˜Shut up, Susan,â€™ said Timothy.
In a voice that was a little higher than his ordinary tones, Gregory 
said, â€˜Donâ€™t speak like that to my wife!â€™ He half rose from his seat. 
Susan said quickly, â€˜Itâ€™s all right, Greg. I donâ€™t mind.â€™]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[After the Funeral
â€˜But I do.â€™
Helen said, â€˜George, I think it would be nice to let your uncle 
have the Spode.â€™
And George, with a slight bow to Helen said, â€˜Anything you 
want me to do, Aunt Helen, I will!â€™
â€˜You didnâ€™t really want it, anyway, did you?â€™ said Helen.
He laughed. â€˜The trouble with you, Aunt Helen, is that you 
see things too clearly! Donâ€™t worry, Uncle Timothy, the Spode is 
yours. It was just my idea of fun.â€™
Timothy leaned forward angrily. â€˜You expected that Richard 
would make you his heir, didnâ€™t you? But my poor brother knew 
where the money would go if you had control of it. You would 
have gambled it away. And he suspected you of being a crook, 
didnâ€™t he?â€™
George said quietly, â€˜Shouldnâ€™t you be careful about what you 
are saying?â€™
â€˜I wasnâ€™t well enough to come here for the funeral,â€™ said 
Timothy, â€˜but Maude told me what Cora said. Cora always was 
a fool â€” but there may have been something in it! And if so, I 
know who Iâ€™d suspect. . .â€™
â€˜Timothy!â€™ Maude stood up. â€˜You must think about your 
health. Come up with me and go straight to bed. Timothy and I, 
Helen, will take the Spode in memory of Richard. There is no 
problem, I hope?â€™
Nobody spoke, and she went out of the room supporting 
Timothy with a hand under his elbow.
Michael Shane laughed. â€˜You know, Iâ€™m enjoying all this! By 
the way, Rosamund and I want that marble table in the green 
sitting room.â€™
â€˜Oh, no,â€™ cried Susan. 7 want that for my new beauty salon â€” 
and I will put a great bouquet of wax flowers on it.â€™]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
â€˜But, darling,â€™ said Rosamund, â€˜u/e want it for the new play. It 
will be absolutely right.â€™
â€˜I see what you mean, Rosamund,â€™ said Susan. â€˜But you could 
easily have a painted table for the stage - it would look just the 
same. But for my beauty salon Iâ€™ve got to have the real thing. We 
will talk about it tomorrow.â€™
â€˜This house is full of so many beautiful things,â€™ Miss Gilchrist 
said. â€˜That green table would look wonderful in your new salon, 
Iâ€™m sure, Mrs Banks. And wax flowers do look so right on that 
table - really artistic and pretty.â€™
Greg said, speaking again in that high nervous voice, 
â€˜Susan wants that table.â€™
There was a moment of unease.
Helen said quickly, â€˜And what do you really want, George?â€™ 
George grinned and the tension relaxed. â€˜Timothyâ€™s played 
the poor sick man for so long that he thinks only about what he 
wants and makes sure he gets it,â€™ said George.
â€˜I donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s anything at all the matter with him,â€™ 
Susan said. â€˜Do you, Rosamund?â€™
â€˜What?â€™
â€˜Anything the matter with Uncle Timothy.â€™
â€˜No - no, I donâ€™t think so.â€™ Rosamund was lost in her own 
thoughts. â€˜Iâ€™m sorry. I was thinking about what stage lighting 
would be right for the table.â€™
â€˜A single-minded woman,â€™ said George. â€˜Your wifeâ€™s 
dangerous, Michael. I hope you realize it.â€™
â€˜I realize it,â€™ said Michael seriously.
Helen changed the subject deliberately, turning to her foreign 
guest. â€˜Iâ€™m afraid this is all very boring for you, Monsieur Pontarlier.â€™ 
â€˜Not at all, Madame. I think it is the greatest honour that I 
am allowed into your family life â€”â€™ he bowed. â€˜I would like to

say that this house will be perfect for my elderly refugees. What 
peace! I hear that there was also the question of a school coming 
here, run by â€œnunsâ€, I think you say? You would have preferred 
that, perhaps?â€™
â€˜Not at all,â€™ said George. â€˜But what I do find strange is why 
they should all dress as if they lived hundreds of years ago!â€™
â€˜And it makes them look so alike, doesnâ€™t it?â€™ said Miss 
Gilchrist. â€˜I got so nervous when I was at Mrs Abernethieâ€™s and a 
nun came to the door. I thought she was the same nun who came 
to the door on the day of the inquest on poor Mrs Lansquenet. I 
felt as though she had been following me round!â€™
â€˜They both had the same type of face?â€™ Hercule Poirot asked. 
â€˜I suppose that must be it. The upper lip looked almost as 
though she had a moustache. Of course it was very foolish of me. 
I knew that afterwards.â€™
â€˜A nunâ€™s costume would be a good disguise.â€™ said Susan 
thoughtfully, â€˜even for a man. It hides the feet.â€™
â€˜The truth is,â€™ said George, â€˜you donâ€™t often look properly at 
anyone. Thatâ€™s why there are such very different descriptions of 
what an accused person looks like from different witnesses in 
court.â€™
â€˜Another strange thing,â€™ said Susan, â€˜is that you sometimes 
see yourself in a mirror unexpectedly and you say to yourself, 
â€œThatâ€™s somebody I know well . . .â€ and then suddenly realize 
itâ€™s you! â€™
George said, â€˜It would be more difficult still if you could 
really see yourself â€” and not a mirror image.â€™
â€˜Why?â€™ asked Rosamund, looking puzzled.
â€˜Because nobody ever sees themselves â€” as they appear to other 
people. They always see themselves in a mirror as a reversed 
image.â€™

â€˜But why does that look any different?â€™
â€˜Because peopleâ€™s faces arenâ€™t the same both sides. Their 
eyebrows are different, and their mouths go up at one side, and 
their noses arenâ€™t really straight.â€™
With a sigh, Hercule Poirot rose to his feet and said a polite 
good night to Helen Abernethie. â€˜And perhaps, Madame, I had 
better say goodbye. My train leaves at nine oâ€™clock tomorrow 
morning. So I will thank you now for all your kindness. You 
will return now to your villa in Cyprus?â€™
â€˜Yes.â€™ A little smile appeared on Helen Abernethieâ€™s lips. 
Poirot said, â€˜You are pleased, yes? You have no regrets?â€™
â€˜At leaving England? Or leaving here, do you mean?â€™
â€˜I meant â€” leaving here.â€™ said Poirot.
â€˜Oh - no. Itâ€™s no good, is it, to hold on to the past? We must 
all leave that behind.â€™
â€˜If we can,â€™ Poirot said. â€˜Sometimes the past will not be left. It 
stays next to us â€” it says, â€œI am not finished with you yet.â€™â€
â€˜You mean,â€™ said Michael, â€˜that your refugees when they come 
here will not be able to put their past completely behind them?â€™ 
â€˜I did not mean my refugees.â€™
â€˜He meant us, darling,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜He means Uncle 
Richard and Aunt Cora and the hatchet and all that.â€™ She turned 
to Poirot. â€˜Didnâ€™t you?â€™
Why do you think that, Madame?â€™
â€˜Because youâ€™re a detective. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re here. NARCO 
or whatever you call it, is just nonsense, isnâ€™t it?â€™]]></text>

There was a moment of great tension. Poirot said, with a little 
bow, â€˜You have great insight. Madame.â€™
â€˜No,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜I saw you once in a restaurant. A friend 
told me who you were.â€™
â€˜But you have not mentioned it - until now? â€™
â€˜I thought it would be more fun not to,â€™ said Rosamund. 
Michael said, â€˜My - dear girl.â€™
Poirot looked at him. Michael was angry. Angry and 
something else - worried?
Poirotâ€™s eyes went slowly round all the faces. Susanâ€™s, angry and 
watchful; Gregoryâ€™s, closed; Miss Gilchristâ€™s, foolish, her mouth 
wide open; Georgeâ€™s, suspicious; Helenâ€™s, upset and nervous.
He wished he could have seen their faces a second earlier, 
when the words â€˜a detectiveâ€™ fell from Rosamundâ€™s lips. â€˜Yes,â€™ 
he said. â€˜I am a detective. I was asked to investigate Richard 
Abernethieâ€™s death. It would be good, would it not, if you could 
be certain that Richard Abernethie died a natural death?â€™
â€˜Of course he died a natural death. Who says anything else?â€™ 
Susan asked.
â€˜Cora Lansquenet said so. And Cora Lansquenet is dead 
herself,â€™ said Poirot.
â€˜She said it in this room,â€™ said Susan. â€˜But I didnâ€™t really 
think . . .â€™
â€˜Didnâ€™t you, Susan?â€™ George Crossfield said. â€˜Why pretend 
any more? You wonâ€™t fool Monsieur Pontarlier!â€™
â€˜We all thought so really,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜And his name is 
Hercules something.â€™
Poirot bowed. â€˜Hercule Poirot - at your service,â€™ he said, but 
his name seemed to mean nothing at all to them.

â€˜May I ask what conclusions you have come to?â€™ asked 
George.
â€˜He wonâ€™t tell you, darling,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜Or if he does 
tell you, what he says wonâ€™t be true.â€™
She was the only person in the room who appeared to be 
amused. Hercule Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.
? ? ?
Hercule Poirot did not sleep well that night. He was anxious, 
and he was not really sure why he was anxious. In his mind 
he heard bits of conversation, saw various glances, strange 
movements . . . Helen dropping the wax flowers when he had 
said â€” what was it he had said? He couldnâ€™t remember . . .
He slept then, and as he slept he dreamed of the green marble 
table. On it were the glass-covered wax flowers â€” only the whole 
thing had been painted over with thick, red oil paint. Paint the 
colour of blood and Timothy was saying, â€˜Iâ€™m dying â€” dying . . . 
this is the end.â€™
The end â€” a deathbed, with candles round it and a nun 
praying. If he could just see the nunâ€™s face, he would know.
Hercule Poirot woke up â€” and he did know!
Yes, it was the end.
Though there was still a long way to go.
? ? ?
Sitting in front of her dressing table, Helen Abernethie stared 
at herself in the mirror. What was it George had said? About 
seeing yourself? That day after the funeral. How had they all 
looked to Cora? How had Helen herself looked?
Her right â€” no, her left eyebrow was arched a little higher 
than the right. The shape of the mouth was the same on both

sides. If she met herself, she would surely not see much difference 
from this mirror image. Not like Cora.
Cora, on the day of the funeral, her head tilted sideways â€” 
asking her question â€” looking at Helen . . .
Suddenly Helen raised her hands to her face. She said to 
herself, â€˜It doesnâ€™t make sense . . .
? ? ?
â€˜Iâ€™m terribly sorry to get you out of bed like this,â€™ Helen 
said into the phone, â€˜but you did tell me once to ring you up 
immediately if I remembered what it was that made me uneasy 
when Cora said that Richard had been murdered.â€™
â€˜Ah! And you have remembered?â€™ Mr Entwhistle said, no 
longer surprised at being woken at seven in the morning.
â€˜Yes, but it doesnâ€™t make sense.â€™
â€˜Was it something you noticed about one of the people?â€™
â€˜Yes. It came to me when I was looking at myself in the 
mirror. Oh . . .â€™
Helenâ€™s little half cry was followed by a sound that Mr 
Entwhistle couldnâ€™t place at all. He said urgently, â€˜Hello â€” 
hello â€” are you there? Helen, are you there?â€™]]></text>

It was not until nearly an hour later that Mr Entwhistle found 
himself at last speaking to Hercule Poirot. â€˜Thank goodness!â€™ 
said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜I had the greatest difficulty in getting 
through to Enderby.â€™
â€˜That is not surprising,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜The receiver was off 
the telephone. Mon ami, Helen Abernethie was found by the 
housemaid about twenty minutes ago, lying by the telephone in 
the study. She was unconscious.â€™
â€˜Do you mean she was hit on the head?â€™
â€˜I think so.â€™
â€˜She was telephoning me at the time. I was puzzled when our 
conversation ended so suddenly.â€™
â€˜What did she say?â€™
â€˜She said to me some time ago that when Cora Lansquenet 
suggested her brother had been murdered, she herself had a 
feeling that something was wrong. Unfortunately she could not 
remember why she had that feeling.â€™
â€˜And suddenly, she did remember and phoned you to tell 
you?â€™
â€˜Yes. She said she had remembered â€” but that it â€œdidnâ€™t make 
senseâ€. I asked her if it was something about one of the people 
who was there that day, and she said, yes, she had remembered 
what it was when she was looking in the mirror â€” and that was 
all. We shall have to wait until she recovers consciousness before 
we know.â€™
Poirot said seriously, â€˜That may be never.â€™
â€˜But â€” thatâ€™s terrible, Poirot!â€™
â€˜Yes. And it shows that we have to deal with someone who 
is either completely ruthless or so frightened that it comes to the]]></text>

same thing. She is being taken to a nursing home where no one 
will be allowed in to see her. But now, there is something that I 
want you to do. One moment.â€™ There was a pause, then Poirotâ€™s 
voice spoke again. â€˜I had to make sure that nobody was listening. 
Now, you will go to Forsdyke House, a nursing home in Bury St 
Edmunds. Find Dr Penrith and ask him about Gregory Banks. 
Find out what kind of mental illness he was being treated for. 
And now â€” goodbye.â€™
Poirot heard the sound of the receiver being replaced at the 
other end, then he heard a very faint second click â€” and smiled 
to himself. Somebody here had been listening and had replaced 
the receiver on the telephone in the hall.
He went out there. There was no one about. He went quietly 
to the cupboard behind the stairs and looked inside. At that 
moment Lanscombe came through the service door carrying a 
tray. He looked surprised to see Poirot. â€˜Breakfast is ready in 
the dining room, Sir,â€™ he said. The old butler looked white and 
nervous.
â€˜Courage,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜All will soon be well. Would it be too 
much trouble to bring me a cup of coffee in my bedroom? â€™ 
â€˜Certainly, Sir. I will send Janet up with it, Sir.â€™
Lanscombe looked disapprovingly at Hercule Poirotâ€™s back as 
Poirot climbed the stairs. The detective was wearing a brightly 
coloured silk dressing gown.
Hercule Poirot was dressed by the time Janet brought him his 
coffee. As soon as she had left the room, Poirot put on his coat 
and hat and went quickly down the back stairs and left the house 
by the side door. Soon he was speaking to Mr Entwhistle from 
the post office.
â€˜Pay no attention to what I asked you to do. Someone was 
listening. Now, to what I really want you to do . . . You must go

to the house of Mr Timothy Abernethie. There is no one there 
but a woman by the name of Jones. You will say to Mrs Jones 
that you have been asked by Mr or Mrs Abernethie to fetch a 
particular object and take it to London.â€™
And what is this object Iâ€™ve got to get hold of?â€™
Poirot told him.
â€˜But really, Poirot, I donâ€™t see â€”â€™
â€˜It is not necessary for you to see. I am doing the seeing. You 
will take it to London, to an address in Elm Park Gardens.â€™
Mr Entwhistle sighed, â€˜If we could only guess what Helen 
was going to tell me.â€™
â€˜There is no need to guess, I know. I know what Helen Abernethie 
saw when she looked in her mirror.â€™
? ? ?
Breakfast had been an uncomfortable meal. Neither 
Rosamund nor Timothy had appeared, but the others were there.
â€˜What I canâ€™t understand,â€™ said Susan, â€˜is what Helen was doing 
telephoning at that early hour, and who she was telephoning.â€™ 
â€˜She probably woke up feeling ill,â€™ said Maude, â€˜and came 
down to ring up the doctor. Then fainted and fell.â€™
The door opened and Rosamund came in, frowning. â€˜I canâ€™t 
find those wax flowers,â€™ she said. â€˜The ones that were standing 
on the marble table on the day of Uncle Richardâ€™s funeral. 
Lanscombe, do you know where they are?â€™
â€˜Mrs Helen had an accident with them, maâ€™am. She was going 
to find a new glass shade. They are in the cupboard behind the 
staircase, maâ€™am.â€™
â€˜Come with me, Michael darling. Itâ€™s dark there, and Iâ€™m not 
going into any dark corners by myself after what happened to 
Aunt Helen.â€™

â€˜What do you mean, Rosamund?â€™ Maude demanded. â€˜She 
fainted and fell.â€™
Rosamund laughed. â€˜Donâ€™t be silly! She was hit on the head. 
Youâ€™ll see, one by one we will be killed and the one thatâ€™s left 
will be the murderer. But itâ€™s not going to be me â€” whoâ€™s killed, 
I mean.â€™
â€˜And why should anyone want to kill you, beautiful 
Rosamund?â€™ asked George.
Rosamund opened her eyes very wide. â€˜Because I know too 
much, of course.â€™
â€˜What do you know? â€™ Maude Abernethie and Gregory Banks 
spoke together.
Rosamund gave her an innocent smile. â€˜Wouldnâ€™t you all like 
to know? Come on, Michael.â€™]]></text>

At eleven oâ€™clock, Hercule Poirot called a meeting in the library. 
â€˜Please listen carefully to what I have to say. I have been a friend 
for many years of Mr Entwhistleâ€™s and he was very upset by some 
words spoken on the day of Richard Abernethieâ€™s funeral by Mrs 
Lansquenet and asked me to investigate.â€™
No one spoke.
Poirot threw back his head. â€˜Eh bien, you will all be delighted 
to hear that as a result of my investigations â€” it is my belief that Mr 
Abernethie died a natural death. That is good news, is it not?â€™
They stared at him and in all but the eyes of one person there 
still seemed to be doubt and suspicion.
The exception was Timothy Abernethie. â€˜Of course Richard 
wasnâ€™t murdered,â€™ he said angrily. â€˜Well, Mr whatever your 
name is, Iâ€™m pleased youâ€™ve had the sense to come to the right 
conclusion, though if you ask me, Entwhistle went far beyond 
his duty as Richardâ€™s lawyer to get you to come nosing about 
here. If the familyâ€™s satisfied . . .â€™
â€˜But the family wasnâ€™t satisfied, Uncle Timothy,â€™ said 
Rosamund. â€˜And what about Aunt Helen this morning?â€™
â€˜Nonsense,â€™ said Maude. â€˜Helen felt ill, came down and 
phoned the doctor, and then . . .â€™
â€˜But she didnâ€™t phone the doctor,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜I asked 
him . . .â€™
Susan said sharply, â€˜Who did she phone?â€™
â€˜I donâ€™t know,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜But Iâ€™m sure I can find 
outâ€™

Hercule Poirot was sitting in the summerhouse. He had told 
everyone that he was leaving on the twelve oâ€™clock train. There 
was still half an hour until then. Half an hour for someone to 
come to him. Perhaps more than one person.
He waited â€” like a cat waiting for a mouse to come out of 
hiding.
It was Miss Gilchrist who came first. â€˜Oh, Mr Pontarlier â€” I 
canâ€™t remember your other name,â€™ she said. â€˜I had to come and 
speak to you, although I donâ€™t like doing it. I did listen at the 
door that day Mr Richard Abernethie came to see his sister and 
he said something like, â€œThereâ€™s no point in talking to Timothy. 
He simply wonâ€™t listen. But I thought Iâ€™d like to tell you, Cora. 
And though youâ€™ve always liked to behave as if you are simple, 
youâ€™ve got a lot of common sense. So what would you do about 
it, if you were me?â€
â€˜I couldnâ€™t hear exactly what Mrs Lansquenet said, but I heard 
the word police â€” and then Mr Abernethie said loudly, â€œI canâ€™t 
do that. Not when itâ€™s a question of my oum niece.â€ And then I 
had to run into the kitchen because something was burning, 
and when I got back Mr Abernethie was saying, â€œEven if I 
die an unnatural death, I donâ€™t want the police called in. You 
understand that, donâ€™t you, my dear girl? But now that I know, I 
shall take all possible precautions.â€ And then he said heâ€™d made 
a mistake over her marriage because she had been happy with 
her husband.â€™
Miss Gilchrist stopped.
Poirot said, â€˜I see â€” I see . . . Thank you, Miss Gilchrist, for 
coming to see me.â€™

Miss Gilchrist had no sooner gone before Gregory Banks 
came.
â€˜At last!â€™ he said. â€˜I thought that stupid woman would never 
go. Youâ€™re wrong about everything. Richard Abernethie 
was killed. I killed him.â€™
Hercule Poirot showed no surprise. â€˜How?â€™
Gregory Banks smiled. â€˜It wasnâ€™t difficult for me. I worked 
out how I didnâ€™t need to be anywhere near Enderby at the 
time.â€™
â€˜Clever,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜Why did you kill him? For the money 
that would come to your wife?â€™
â€˜No. No, of course not. I didnâ€™t marry Susan for her money! 
Abernethie thought I was no good! He sneered at me! People 
canâ€™t do that to me and not be punished!â€™
â€˜A most successful murder,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜But why give yourself 
away â€” to me?â€™
â€˜Because I had to show you that youâ€™re not as clever as you 
think you are - and besides - besides - It was wrong, wicked . . . 
I must be punished ... I must go back there â€” to the place of 
punishment.! â€™
Poirot studied him for a moment or two. â€˜How badly do you 
want to get away from your wife?â€™
Gregoryâ€™s face changed. Why couldnâ€™t she let me alone? 
Sheâ€™s coming now â€” across the lawn. Tell her Iâ€™ve gone to the 
police station. To confess.â€™
? ? ?
Susan came in breathlessly. â€˜Whereâ€™s Greg? I saw him.â€™
â€˜Yes. He came to tell me that it was he who poisoned Richard 
Abernethie.â€™

â€˜What absolute nonsensel He wasnâ€™t even near this place when 
Uncle Richard died!â€™
â€˜Perhaps not. Where was he when Cora Lansquenet died?â€™
â€˜In London. We both were.â€™
Hercule Poirot shook his head. â€˜No, no. You went to Lytchett 
St Mary. My inquiries say that you were there on the afternoon 
Cora Lansquenet died. You parked your car in the same quarry 
where you left it the morning of the inquest. The car was seen 
and the number was noted.â€™
Susan stared at him. â€˜All right. What Cora said at the funeral 
worried me. I decided to go and see her, and ask her what had put 
the idea into her head. I got there about three oâ€™clock, knocked 
and rang, but there was no answer. I didnâ€™t go round to the back of 
the cottage. If I had, I might have seen the broken window. I went 
back to London without any idea there was anything wrong.â€™
â€˜I know something of your husbandâ€™s history,â€™ said Poirot. 
â€˜He has a punishment complex.â€™
â€˜You donâ€™t understand, Monsieur Poirot. Greg has never had 
a chance in life. Thatâ€™s why I wanted Uncle Richardâ€™s money so 
badly. I knew Greg needed to feel he was someone. Everything 
will be different now. He will have his own laboratory. No one 
will tell him what to do.â€™
â€˜Yes, yes â€” you will give him everything â€” but you cannot 
give to people what they are not capable of receiving. At the 
end of it all, he will still be something that he does not want 
to be.â€™
â€˜Whatâ€™s that?â€™
â€˜Susanâ€™s husband. Where Gregory Banks is concerned you have 
no sense of right or wrong. You wanted your uncleâ€™s money - for 
your husband. How badly did you want it?â€™

Angrily, Susan turned and ran away

â€˜I thought,â€™ said Michael Shane, â€˜that Iâ€™d just come and say 
goodbye.â€™
â€˜Your wife Rosamund,â€™ said Poirot, â€˜is a very unusual 
woman.â€™
Michael raised his eyebrows. â€˜Sheâ€™s lovely, I agree. But sheâ€™s 
not known for her intelligence.â€™
â€˜She will never be clever,â€™ Poirot agreed. â€˜But she knows what 
she wants.â€™ He sighed. â€˜So few people do.â€™ Poirot placed the tips 
of his fingers together. â€˜There have been inquiries made, you 
know. Not only by me.â€™
â€˜You mean â€” the police are interested? And theyâ€™ve been 
making inquiries about me?â€™
Poirot said quietly, â€˜They are interested in the movements of 
Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s relations on the day that she was killed.â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s extremely awkward. I told Rosamund that I was 
having lunch with Oscar Lewis on that day. Actually I went 
to see a woman called Sorrel Dainton - and though thatâ€™s 
satisfactory as far as the police are concerned, Rosamund wonâ€™t 
be pleased.â€™
â€˜I see - I see - and this Miss Dainton, she will confirm your 
alibi?â€™
â€˜She wonâ€™t like it â€” but sheâ€™ll do it.â€™
â€˜She would do it, perhaps, even if you were not having an 
affair with her.â€™
â€˜What do you mean?â€™
â€˜The lady is in love with you. When they are in love, women 
will swear to what is true â€” and also to what is untrue.â€™

â€˜I heard you were here, Monsieur Poirot,â€™ said Inspector Morton 
when they were alone. â€˜I came over with Superintendent Parwell. 
Dr Larraby phoned him about Mrs Helen Abernethie and heâ€™s 
come over to make inquiries. I wanted to ask a few questions â€” 
and the people I wanted to ask seemed, very conveniently, to be 
all here. Did you do that?â€™
â€˜Yes, I did.â€™
â€˜And as a result someone hit Mrs Helen Abernethie on the head.â€™ 
â€˜You must not blame me for that. If she had come to me .. . 
But she did not. Instead she called her lawyer in London. Now, I 
will ask you, my friend, to give me a few more hours, then I may 
be able to hand you a piece of solid evidence.â€™
â€˜We certainly need it,â€™ said Inspector Morton. â€˜Though we 
have our found out that two nuns were out collecting money 
and went to Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s cottage on the day before she was 
murdered. No one answered when they knocked and rang â€” Mrs 
Lansquenet was at the Abernethie funeral and Gilchrist had gone 
out for the day. The point is that they say they heard sighs and 
groans from inside the cottage. So was there someone there? 
And if so, who? All the Abernethie family were at the funeral.â€™ 
â€˜These nuns, did they return at a later date to try again?â€™ 
â€˜Actually, they did â€” on the day of the inquest.â€™
â€˜That fits,â€™ said Hercule Poirot. â€˜You will have noticed, 
Inspector, that the visit of the nuns was the same day that 
poisoned wedding cake found its way into that cottage.â€™
â€˜Thatâ€™s a ridiculous idea!â€™
â€˜My ideas are never ridiculous,â€™ said Hercule Poirot. â€˜And 
now, mon cher, I must go in search of the late Richard Abernethieâ€™s 
niece.â€™

Poirot found Rosamund sitting on a bench by a little pool.
â€˜I thought youâ€™d gone,â€™ she said. â€˜Itâ€™s past twelve oâ€™clock.â€™
â€˜I have missed my train,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜Do you know, Madame, 
I have been sitting in the little summerhouse hoping that you 
would, perhaps, visit me there?â€™
â€˜Why should I? I had a lot to think about. I donâ€™t often do 
much thinking â€” it seems a waste of time. But this is important. 
I think one ought to plan oneâ€™s life just as one wants it to be.â€™ 
â€˜And that is what you are doing? â€™
â€˜Well, yes... I was trying to make a decision about something.â€™ 
â€˜About your husband? â€™
â€˜In a way.â€™
Poirot waited a moment, then he said, â€˜Inspector Morton 
has just arrived. He has come to get statements from you all 
about what you were doing on the day Cora Lansquenet was 
murdered.â€™
â€˜I see. Alibis,â€™ said Rosamund cheerfully. â€˜That will be hell

woman.â€™
â€˜How did you know? â€™
â€˜It was obvious from the way he said he was going to lunch 
with Oscar, and his face always does something strange when he 
tells lies.â€™

The telegram came about six oâ€™clock that evening, and then 
Hercule Poirot gathered his audience and began speaking. â€˜The 
puzzle is solved. Let me first, go over the various points which 
were brought to my attention by the excellent Mr Entwhistle.
â€˜First, Mr Richard Abernethie dies suddenly. Secondly, after 
his funeral, his sister Cora Lansquenet says, â€œHe was murdered, 
wasnâ€™t he?â€ Thirdly Mrs Lansquenet is killed. Then Miss 
Gilchrist becomes ill after eating a piece of wedding cake, which 
was poisoned with arsenic. That is the next step in the sequence.
â€˜I have found nothing to prove that Mr Abernethie was 
poisoned. Equally, I have found nothing to prove that he was not. 
But Cora Lansquenet undoubtedly asked that shocking question. 
And undoubtedly Mrs Lansquenet was murdered. Now, the post 
van driver strongly believes that he did not deliver that wedding 
cake. If that is so, then the parcel was left by hand and though 
we cannot exclude a â€œperson unknownâ€ â€” we must consider 
those people who were able to put the parcel where it was found. 
Those were: Miss Gilchrist herself, of course; Susan Banks; Mr 
Entwhistle and Mr Guthrie, an art critic; and a nun or nuns who 
called to collect money.
â€˜Miss Gilchrist did not benefit by Richard Abernethieâ€™s death 
and in only a very small way by the death of Mrs Lansquenet â€” 
and Miss Gilchrist was taken to hospital with arsenic poisoning.
â€˜Susan Banks did benefit from Richard Abernethieâ€™s death, and 
in a small way from Mrs Lansquenetâ€™s. She might have believed 
that Miss Gilchrist had overheard a conversation between Cora 
Lansquenet and Richard Abernethie which referred to her. 
Because of that she might have decided that Miss Gilchrist must 
be killed. She did, after all, refuse to eat the wedding cake.
93]]></text>
  </page>
  <page pageNumber = "99">
     <text><![CDATA[Agatha Christie
â€˜Mr Entwhistle did not benefit by either of the deaths - but 
he did have considerable control over Mr Abernethieâ€™s affairs, 
and there could easily be some reason why Richard Abernethie 
should not live too long. But â€” you will say â€” if it is Mr Entwhistle 
who was worried, why should he come to me?
And that I will answer â€” it is not the first time that a murderer 
has been too sure of himself.
â€˜We now come to Mr Guthrie. If Mr Guthrie is really Mr 
Guthrie, the art critic, then that clears him. The same is true for 
the nun, if she is really a nun. The question is: are these people 
themselves, or are they somebody else?
And there seems to be a strange â€” pattern â€” one might call 
it â€” of a nun all through this business. A nun comes to the door 
of Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house and Miss Gilchrist believes it 
is the same nun she has seen at Coraâ€™s house. Also a nun, or nuns, 
called here the day before Mr Abernethie died.
â€˜Other features of the case caught my attention: the visit of 
an art critic, a smell of oil paint, a picture postcard of Polflexan 
harbour, and finally a bouquet of wax flowers.
â€˜It was thinking about these things that led me to the truth. 
Richard Abernethie died suddenly â€” but there would have been 
no reason to suspect murder if it had not been for the words said 
by his sister Cora at his funeral. You all believed them because 
Cora Lansquenet had always been famous for speaking the truth 
at difficult moments.
â€˜And now I come to the question that I suddenly asked myself: 
How well did you all know Cora Lansquenet? And Not well at all is 
the answer! There were actually only three people present that 
day who really knew Cora. Lanscombe, the butler, who is old 
and almost blind; Mrs Maude Abernethie who had only seen 
her a few times round about the date of her own wedding; and

Mrs Helen Abernethie who had not seen her for over thirty 
years.
â€˜So I said to myself: â€œSupposing it was not Cora Lansquenet 
who came to the funeral that day?â€™â€
â€˜Do you mean that it wasnâ€™t Aunt Cora who was murdered, 
but someone else?â€™ Susan demanded.
â€˜No, no, it was Cora Lansquenet who was murdered. But it 
was not Cora Lansquenet who came to the funeral. The woman who 
came that day came for one purpose only â€” to create in the 
minds of his relations the idea that Richard Abernethie had been 
murdered!â€™
â€˜Why? What was the point of it? â€™ Maude asked.
â€˜To draw attention away from the murder of Cora Lansquenet herself 
For if Cora says that Richard has been murdered, and the next 
day she herself is killed, then her death will be believed to be the 
result of what she said. But if Cora had simply been murdered 
without making her comment about Richardâ€™s death, and if the 
â€œrobberyâ€ did not convince the police, then suspicion would be 
likely to fall on the woman who shared the house with her.â€™
Miss Gilchrist protested, â€˜Oh really, you donâ€™t suggest Iâ€™d 
commit a murder for a piece of jewellery and a few worthless 
watercolours?â€™
â€˜No,â€™ said Poirot. â€˜But one of those watercolours represented 
Polflexan harbour which, as Mrs Banks realized, had been copied 
from a picture postcard which showed the old pier still in position. 
Yet Mrs Lansquenet painted always from life. Mr Entwhistle had 
mentioned there being a smell of oil paint in the cottage. You 
can paint, canâ€™t you, Miss Gilchrist? And you had been painting 
over another picture. You know a lot about painting. Supposing 
that one of the pictures that Cora bought at a sale was a really 
valuable one. Supposing that she did not recognize it, but that

you did. You knew she was expecting a visit from a well-known 
art critic. Then her brother died suddenly â€” and a plan comes 
into your head. It was easy to put a sleeping drug in her morning 
tea that would keep her unconscious for the whole of the day of 
the funeral whilst you played her part at Enderby. She talked a lot 
about her childhood days so it was easy for you to â€œrememberâ€ 
incidents and objects. You were wearing Coraâ€™s clothes, with 
padding to make you look larger, and a false fringe. And Cora 
had certain mannerisms, all of which you had practised carefully 
before a mirror.
â€˜But you forgot that a mirror image is reversed. When you saw in 
the glass the perfect reproduction of Coraâ€™s sideways movement 
of the head, you didnâ€™t realize that it was actually the wrong way 
round. You saw Cora tilting her head to the right â€” but your own 
head was tilted to the left to produce that effect in the mirror.
â€˜That was what puzzled Helen Abernethie at the moment 
when you asked your famous question. Something seemed to 
her â€œwrongâ€. I realized myself the other night when Rosamund 
Shane made an unexpected comment about what happens on 
such an occasion. Everybody looks at the speaker. After the talk 
about mirror images, I think Helen Abernethie experimented 
before her mirror. She probably thought of Cora, remembered 
how Cora used to tilt her head to the right, did so, and looked in 
the mirror â€” when, of course, she realized just what had been 
wrong on the day of the funeral. She was determined to tell Mr 
Entwhistle of her discovery as soon as she woke next morning. 
But someone who was used to getting up early followed her 
downstairs and hit her on the head.
â€˜I may as well tell you now that Mrs Abernethie is not 
seriously ill. She will soon be able to tell us her own story. That 
aside, at any moment you were prepared to admit that you had

listened to a conversation between Richard and his sister. What 
he actually told her, no doubt, was the fact that he had not long 
to live, and that explains a phrase in the letter he wrote to her 
after getting home. The â€œnunâ€ was another of your suggestions. 
The nuns who called at the cottage on the day of the inquest 
suggested to you a mention of a nun who was â€œfollowing you 
roundâ€, and you used that when you were anxious to hear what 
Maude Abernethie was saying to her sister-in-law at Enderby. 
And also because you wished to go with her there and find out 
for yourself just what suspicions there were. To poison yourself, 
badly but not fatally, with arsenic, is a very old trick- and made 
Inspector Morton suspicious of you.â€™
â€˜But the picture?â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜What was it?â€™
Poirot slowly unfolded a telegram. â€˜This morning Mr 
Entwhistle went to Mr Timothy Abernethieâ€™s house to look 
among the pictures in Miss Gilchristâ€™s room. He was to take 
the one of Polflexan Harbour to London and go to Mr Guthrie 
whom I had contacted by telegram. The hastily painted sketch of 
Polflexan was removed from the surface and the original picture 
was exposed.â€™
He held up the telegram and read:
â€˜Definitely a Vermeer. Guthrie.â€™
Suddenly, Miss Gilchrist spoke. â€˜I knew it was a Vermeer. 
She didnâ€™t know! She was always talking about Enderby, and 
what they did there as children. You donâ€™t know how boring 
it is, listening to somebody saying the same things, hour after 
hour and day after day. Boring - boring - boring. And nothing to 
look forward to. And then - a Vermeer! Another Vermeer sold 
recently for over five thousand pounds!â€™
â€˜You killed her for five thousand pounds?â€™ Susanâ€™s voice was 
shocked.

â€˜Five thousand pounds,â€™ said Poirot, â€˜would have paid for

â€˜At least,â€™ Miss Gilchrist said, â€˜you understand. I was going to 
call it the Palm Tree. And have wooden tables â€” and little chairs 
with striped red and white cushions . . .â€™
For a few moments, the tearoom that would never be, seemed 
more real than the sitting room at Enderby.
It was Inspector Morton who broke the silence by asking 
Miss Gilchrist to go with him.
â€˜Oh, certainly,â€™ she said. â€˜I donâ€™t want to give any trouble. 
After all, if I canâ€™t have the Palm Tree, nothing really seems to 
matter very much . . .â€™
She went out of the room with him and Susan said, her 
voice still shaken, â€˜Iâ€™ve never imagined a ladylike murderer. Itâ€™s

â€˜But I donâ€™t understand the connection between the wax flowers 
and the marble table,â€™ said Rosamund.
They were at Helenâ€™s flat and Rosamund and Poirot were 
having tea with her.
â€˜The table, no. But Miss Gilchrist said how nice the wax 
flowers looked on the green marble table. And she could not 
have seen them there. Because they had been broken and put 
away before she arrived. So she could only have seen them when she 
was there as Cora Lansquenet.â€™
â€˜That was stupid of her, wasnâ€™t it?â€™ said Rosamund.
Poirot shook a fmger at her. â€˜It shows you, Madame, the 
dangers of conversations. It is a strong belief of mine that if you 
can get a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject 
ivhatever â€” sooner or later they will give themselves away. Miss 
Gilchrist did.â€™
â€˜I shall have to be careful,â€™ said Rosamund thoughtfully. â€˜Did 
you know? Iâ€™m going to have a baby. And Iâ€™ve decided to leave 
the stage and just be a mother. Michael is delighted. I didnâ€™t really 
think he would be. So Susanâ€™s got the marble table. I thought, as 
I was having a baby . . .â€™
She left the sentence unfinished.
â€˜I think Susan is going to have a big success with her beauty 
business,â€™ said Helen.
â€˜Yes, she was born to succeed,â€™ said Poirot.
â€˜Gregâ€™s gone away somewhere,â€™ said Rosamund. â€˜Heâ€™s having 
a rest cure, Susan says.â€™
Poirot turned to Helen. â€˜And you, Madame, are off to 
Cyprus?â€™

â€˜Yes, in two weeks.â€™
â€˜Then let me wish you a happy journey.â€™
She went with him to the door, and said, â€˜Monsieur 
Poirot, the income Richard left me meant more to me than 
theirs did to any of the others. You see â€” there is a child 
in Cyprus . . . After my husband died, my loneliness was 
unbelievable and when I was nursing in London at the end 
of the war, I met someone . . . We lived together for a little 
while, then he went back to Canada â€” to his wife and his 
children. He never knew about â€” our child. It seemed like 
a miracle to me â€” a middle-aged woman with everything 
seemingly behind her. Now, with Richardâ€™s money, I can 
send my â€œnephewâ€ to an even better school, and give him 
a start in life. I never told Richard. He was fond of me - but 
he would not have understood. I wanted you to know this 
about me.â€™
Poirot bowed over her hand.
? ? ?
He got home to find someone sitting in the armchair on the 
left of the fireplace.
â€˜Hello, Poirot,â€™ said Mr Entwhistle. â€˜Iâ€™ve just come back from 
the trial. They brought in a verdict of guilty, of course. But 
Miss Gilchrist is happy, you know. She spends most of her time 
making plans to run a chain of tearooms.â€™
â€˜Some people might think that she was always a little mad,â€™ 
said Poirot. â€˜But me, I think not.â€™
â€˜Goodness me, no, Poirot! She was as sane as you and I 
when she planned Coraâ€™s murder and carried it out in cold 
blood.â€™]]></text>

Wills and inheritance
A will is a legal document that describes how the money and property 
that someone leaves when they die is to be distributed to relatives and 
other people. It wasn't unusual for servants, like the old butler 
Lanscombe, to receive a sum of money to thank them for their loyal 
service. Wills were usually made in a solicitorâ€™s office but not always. 
To be legal, the signing of the will had to be witnessed, i.e. seen, by 
two people (usually not relatives) who knew the person writing the 
will. In addition to the two witnesses there had to be an executor. 
The executor was the person chosen by the person making the will to 
make sure that their wishes were carried out properly Quite often the 
solicitor would be named as the executor, but it wasnâ€™t unusual for a 
family member, like Timothy, Richard Abernethieâ€™s brother, to be 
named.
Tearooms
Today's coffee shop or cafe, selling Italian or American coffee and 
pastries, had not, at the time of the story (early 1950s), come to Britain. 
Tearooms, however, were very common everywhere. People would go to 
them to drink good quality tea and eat homemade cakes, sandwiches 
and scones. They were highly respectable places and the customers were 
usually middle and upper class women who had been out shopping. 
Before the war, a lot of the food people ate in Britain was sent in from 
other countries by ship. When the war started, this was no longer 
possible because the boats that usually brought the food were attacked 
and destroyed and the food did not arrive.
The government had to make sure that there was enough food, not 
only for the people in Britain, but also for the soldiers fighting in the war. 
They did this by controlling how much food each person could buy every

week. This was called rationing and most items of food, for example, 
meat, butter, eggs, tea, biscuits, fruit, sugar and chocolate were rationed. 
Food rationing lasted until 1954.
Inquests
If a death has been caused by anything other than natural causes, for 
example, a heart attack or long illness (as with Richard Abernethie) an 
inquest must be held. This is a public inquiry with a jury of twelve ordinary 
people, and a coroner, who is in charge at the inquest. Everybody, 
including members of the public, listen to the evidence. The jury then 
give their verdict and say what the cause of death was, for example, 
natural death, accidental death, suicide or murder. In the case of murder, 
a police investigation then takes place.
Post mortems, autopsies
In the UK, when a person dies, a doctor has to certify the cause of 
death. If the doctor does not know exactly why the person died, and 
the death was sudden and rather suspicious, they have to do a post 
mortem, also called an autopsy. This is a medical examination done by 
a doctor called a pathologist, who removes the internal organs of the 
dead person and examines them to discover the cause of death. When 
Richard Abernethie died, it was decided that an autopsy was 
unnecessary because he had been ill. Later when there was some doubt 
about the cause of his death, an autopsy was impossible because his 
body had been cremated (see Glossary). With the murder of one of 
Richardâ€™s relatives later in the story, an autopsy was again not done 
because the cause of death was obvious - the victim had been violently 
attacked.]]></text>

Monsieur Poirot
Poirot is from Belgium and his first language is French, not English. His 
language is quite formal, which makes it sound â€˜foreignâ€™ to a native 
speaker. Sometimes Poirot says things that are not completely correct. 
The word order he uses may be wrong or he may use a word wrongly, for 
example, he may say good when he should have said well or the other 
way round. He often uses little French expressions like mort ami (my 
friend) or Eh bien (Oh well).
Wedding cake
At the time of the story, if you had been invited to a wedding but were 
unable to attend, it was usual for the couple getting married to send you 
a piece of their wedding cake in a small box.
Trust fund
A trust fund is an amount of money that belongs to someone but is 
managed by someone else, for example, if the person is too young or 
they are not considered responsible or knowledgeable enough to take 
care of it themselves. Quite often the money is invested and the person 
who owns it only receives the profits or interest, leaving the original 
amount safe. It is common for a solicitor to be the person who controls 
a trust fund. In the story, Richardâ€™s nephew George, who is a solicitor, is 
suspected of using money from his clientsâ€™ trust funds to gamble with at 
the horse races.
Refugees
Refugees are people who have to leave their countries because of their 
political or religious beliefs. At the time this story was written, there were 
many refugees in Britain. Some were Jews who had left Eastern Europe 
during or before the Second World War, others had come as a result of 
the expansion of Communism in Eastern Europe after the war. Nobody 
would have thought it unusual for someone like Poirot to be representing 
an organization that helped refugees.]]></text>

Vermeer
Johan Vermeer was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the 
seventeenth century (1632-1675) although his paintings did not 
become valuable until the nineteenth century. Thirty-four paintings have 
been identified as being his work although he is actually believed to have 
painted sixty-six. At the time of the story, it was quite possible that a 
previously unknown painting by Vermeer could be discovered. It would 
have been very valuable.]]></text>
